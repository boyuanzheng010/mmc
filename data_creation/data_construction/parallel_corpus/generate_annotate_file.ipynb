You know , not stop being you . You know , Terri 's still on your case , you lost at regionals , Glee 's still the bottom pickle in the barrel ... You and Carl . Yeah . Me and Carl . Especially me and Carl . Look , have you ever noticed that Britney Spears only makes great music when she 's not chasing down paparazzi ? She ca n't just swallow a grenade and let her talent explode all over the wall . She 's got to rein it in , just like you do . You 're such a great teacher , Will . No , probably the best in the whole school . So why would you want to be someone else when the someone that you already are is so amazing ?

I 'm really happy that her music has inspired so many of you , even if that inspiration was brought about by a dangerous narcotic . And I think we 've all come to appreciate her music and celebrity so much more this week . But honestly , she 's just not us . I 'm devastated . I ca n't believe we only did one Britney number . I was actually gon na do something from our original assignment last week : Adult Contemporary . But this is just a little bit more Young Adult . Great , Rachel . Well , let 's hear it . I 'd like to dedicate this song to my boyfriend , Finn . I should n't try to control you . I 've never been this happy before . And I realize that I was trying to hold onto how you were making me feel so much , that I was strangling you in my hands , like a little bird .

But as you live in the same building , you see each other all the time . The variable which has changed is the coitus . Okay , here 's the protocol : you and I are still friends , and you stop saying \" coitus . \" Good , good . I 'm glad we 're still friends . Really ? Oh , yes . It was a lot of work to accommodate you in my life . I 'd hate for that effort to have been in vain . Right . Just to be clear , do I have to stop saying \" coitus \" with everyone or just you ? Harsh terms . But all right- I 'll just substitute \" intercourse . \" Great . Or \" fornication . \" But that has judgmental overtones , so I 'll hold that in reserve . So , how you been ? Well , my existence is a continuum , so I 've been what I am at each point in the implied time period . You 're just coitusing with me , are n't you ? Bazinga . How 's Leonard doing ? He seems all right . Although he does spend a disturbing amount of time looking at photographs of you and smelling the pillow you slept on . Oh , but now that I think of it , he asked me not to tell you that . I 'll pretend I did n't hear it . I 'd rather you pretend I did n't say it . I see you bought Mama Italia marinara spaghetti sauce . Yep . That 's the sauce my mother uses . She likes cooking Italian because according to her , that 's what the Romans made Jesus eat . I 'll have to have you over for spaghetti some night . I 'm hungry now . Oh . Um , okay . Why do n't you give me an hour and come over ? Will you cut up hot dogs into little chunks and mix them in with the sauce ? I do n't have hot dogs . Oh , it 's all right ; I do . Oh ! You 're in for what my mother calls \" a real Eye - talian treat \" \" Hey , where you been ? I was talking with Penny . What 's wrong with you ? You ca n't hang out with your roommate 's ex .

Because I 'd like to erase Ben Affleck as Daredevil . So would Ben Affleck . The point is , in a situation like this you got to pick sides . You 're either on Team Leonard or Team Penny . Which one picks last ? Well , usually I 'm on the team that picks last . Unless there 's a kid in a wheelchair . Sheldon , I got you your tangerine chicken . I hope you 're hungry . Well , of course I 'm hungry . And as I have no plans to eat with any other team , I will consume my tangerine chicken with the appropriate gusto . Just out of curiosity , do we still have hot dogs ?

Do you want the last dumpling , Sheldon ? Certainly . It 's not like I have to moderate my food intake because I 'm planning on eating again very shortly . So , you guys want to do something tonight ? Nah , I ca n't . I got to pick up my mom from her water aerobics class . 18 overweight women flapping their arm fat in a swimming pool . Looks like the manatee tank at Sea World . What about you , Raj ? Oh , there it is : now that you do n't have a girlfriend , you want to hang out with me again . I never stopped hanging out with you . Oh , please , we all know I 'm the friend you call when you have no other options . If we were the Justice League , I 'd be Aquaman . I wish you were Aquaman . Then I could send you to scoop my mom out of the old lady tank . Excuse me , I 'm thirsty , so I 'm going to go to the refrigerator and get myself a refreshing beverage . I 'll just spend the evening alone . What , suddenly I 'm not good enough for you ? I do so love beverages . Now I think I 'll take my after - dinner walk . Since when do you take after - dinner walks ? Yeah , since when do you take walks ? I read a study online that walking after a meal not only aids in digestion , but increases serotonin , and you know me , if there 's one thing I like more than a refreshing beverage , it 's serotonin . Bye - bye . Hold on . I 'll walk down with you . Oh ... that 's not necessary . Or we could go together . I ca n't think of a reason why not . Let 's go . Hold on . Nope , no reason . I 've missed you . All right , say hello to your mother for me . You said you were going for a walk . I did n't say outside . So what , you 're just gon na walk up and down the stairs ? That would be odd and suspicious behavior . Here , Russell ! Here , boy ! Which way are you going ? Which way are you going ? I parked my scooter down the block . I 'm going the other way . Bye . Actually , I 'm this way . Do I smell hot dogs ? No . I mean , I have no idea what you smell . I definitely smell raw hot dog . Perhaps you 're getting a brain tumor . All right , have a nice walk . I shall . Have a nice scoot . You might want to stand back . I 'm sitting on top of 13 horses here . Hello , doggie . Nice doggie . I bet you think you smell hot dogs . Look , a cat ! SHELDON Penny ? Penny . I had to trade the others for my life . Hey , Leonard ? Yeah ? I have n't had sex in a year . Where you going with this , Raj ? Do n't flatter yourself , dude . I want to go out and meet a woman . So , go . Well , I need a wingman . I do n't want to come off like a lonely loser . And you think my presence will help with that ? Well , I do . Next to you , I 'll look like a catch . I 'm not going out tonight , Raj . Would you mind if I went to your room and downloaded some Asian pornography ? Very much . Does n't have to be Asian . Do n't worry . You 'll meet a girl someday . No , I wo n't . Yes , you will , and she 'll be beautiful . And kind and sexy and funny and everything you ever wanted in a woman . You really think so ? I do , and you 'll fall hopelessly in love and give her your heart . And she 'll take it and grind it into pathetic , little pieces . But we 'll have sex first , right ? That 's Eye - talian . So , um , was Leonard okay with you coming over ? Oh , yes . In fact , he said , \" I 'm fine . I do n't care . \" And he in no way said it in a manner which would lead one to believe that he was covering up feelings of anguish and betrayal . Well , good . I 'm also pleased to report that he 's all cried out over you . He 's been crying ? Oh , I believe that was something else I was n't supposed to mention . Oh , God , I feel terrible . Do you have a stomachache , too ? No . Why , do you ? Why did you ask if I had one , too ? Just making polite dinner conversation . Your turn . All right . So , what 's new in your life ? Well , my new shoes are not made for running . Have you been running ? No . It 's just a suspicion I have . I 'm so glad you like it . I do . Leonard never cooks for me . Well , maybe that 's 'cause Leonard ca n't cook . You ca n't cook and you made me this . Ooh , I 'm gon na get the cheesecake out of the fridge . Oh , Lord , I 'm in Jewish hell . Look at this . Do you think she 's really doing that or is it PhotoShop ? I 'm pretty sure Martha Stewart never got naked with a room full of big , fat Japanese guys . You do n't know that . Prison changes people . I told you , walking . For an hour and a half ? I got lost . How could you get lost ? Your phone has GPS . Satellites are down . Solar flares . There are no solar flares right now . Yes , there are . Dude , I 'm an astrophysicist . If there were solar flares , I 'd be all up in it . I 'm sorry . I misspoke . What I meant to say was my battery died . What the hell was that about ? Do you think this is really Hillary Clinton doing it with Oprah ? Oh , we really need to get you a girl . SHELDON Leonard . Leonard . Leonard . Oh , just come in ! Thanks for seeing me on such short notice . What do you want , Sheldon ? Maybe this is n't a good time . Tell me why you woke me up or I swear to God I will kill you . Do you really think death threats are an appropriate way to begin this conversation ? Sometimes your lack of social skills astonishes me . You may want to sit down . I 'm in bed ! Point taken . You may want to sit up . I 've been seeing Penny behind your back . When you say \" seeing Penny , \" what exactly does that mean ? We had dinner last night . She made me spaghetti with little hot dogs cut up in it . Well , little hot dog . I gave up the other five hot dogs to a real dog . A real , big dog . A hell hound . Tangential to the primary story . How about I circle back to it ? Why did you have dinner with Penny ? I told you , she made spaghetti with little hot dogs . I like spaghetti with little hot dogs . Then why did you have Chinese food with us ? I did n't want to upset you . Howard made it very clear that my allegiance should be to male comrades before women who sell their bodies for money . Is it possible he said , \" Bros before hos \" ? Yes , but I rephrased it to avoid offending the hos . Sheldon , I do n't care if you want to be friends with Penny . Oh . Well , so the emotional turmoil that 's been keeping me from achieving REM sleep was entirely unjustified ? Yes . Well ... then as my meemaw would say , \" Looks like we butchered a pig , but nobody wanted bacon . \" And now , as promised , the tangent . Sheldon and the Hell Hound . Or How I Lost My Hot Dogs .

What 's \" KBB \" ? \" Killed by badger . \" How 's that ? It was Thanksgiving . Uncle Carl said , \" I think \" there 's a badger living in our chimney . Hand me that flashlight . \" Those were the last words he ever spoke to us . I do n't think you need to worry about death by badgers being hereditary . Not true . The fight or flight instinct is coded genetically . Instead of fleeing , he chose to fight barehanded against a brawny member of the weasel family . Who 's to say that I do n't share that flawed DNA ? You can always get a badger and find out . But seriously , even if I disregard the Uncle Carl factor , at best I have 60 years left . That long , huh ? 60 only takes me to here . I need to get to here . What 's there ? The earliest estimate of the singularity , when man will be able to transfer his consciousness into machines and achieve immortality . So , you 're upset about missing out on becoming some sort of freakish self - aware robot ? By this much . Tough break . You want eggs ? You do n't get it , Leonard . I 'm going to miss so much-- the unified field theory , cold fusion , the dogapus . What 's a dogapus ? The hybrid dog and octopus . Man 's underwater best friend . Is somebody working on that ? I was going to . I planned on giving it to myself on my 300th birthday . Wait a minute . You hate dogs . A dogapus can play fetch with eight balls . No one can hate that . ♪ Then nearly 14 billion years ago expansion started ... ♪ The Earth began to cool ♪ ♪ That all started with a big bang ♪ ♪ Bang ! ♪ The Big Bang Theory 4x0 The Cruciferous Vegetable Amplification Original Air Date on September 30 , 2010 What do we owe you ? It came to $ 28.17 . Let 's say six bucks apiece . Never mind . I got it . Oh , you wanted me to pay . It 's no big deal . No , no , no , no . You 're right . We 're not going out anymore ; I should pay for myself . He said , \" If he had woman parts , he 'd eat for free the rest of his life \" . Yeah , but you would n't be able to talk to yourself . I 'm a little low on cash . How much you got ? Nothing . How can you walk around with no money ? I 'm cute . I get by . It 's okay , you can owe me . Thank you . Sheldon , six bucks . No , thank you . I 'm not eating pizza tonight . But it 's Thursday . Thursday 's pizza night . Not for me . Thursday is now Cruciferous Vegetable Night . Tonight 's selection : Brussels sprouts . You 're changing the Sheldonian calendar ? It 's a small price to pay . For what ? No , no , do n't ask . Sorry , sorry , sorry , sorry , sorry . In order to live long enough to fuse my consciousness with cybernetics , I need to change my diet . Wait . Cybernetics is robot stuff , right ? So you want to turn yourself into some sort of robot ? Essentially , yes . Okay , here 's my question . Did n't you already do that ? No . Flattering , but sadly , no . I 'm also planning to begin an exercise regimen designed to strengthen my cardiovascular system . AKA jogging . Wait . Honey , have you ever run before ? Certainly . I 've run from bullies , dogs , angry chickens ... and one particularly persistent P.E. teacher determined to bend me over and give me a scoliosis test . You 're right . Penny jogs . Maybe you guys can run together . That 's an excellent idea . Yeah , if we chat , it will create the illusion of time going faster . Um , how does he know I jog ? Oh , he watches you from his car with high - powered binoculars . Oh , my God , that is so creepy ! I know ! And he says he 's not gon na stop . Then see a shrink and figure out how to talk to women . I have pain radiating from my navel to my lower right abdomen . I 'm nauseated and feverish . I believe I may have cholera . There 's no cholera in Pasadena . Just like last summer , when there was no malaria in Pasadena . Well , if it 's not cholera , then based on a quick Internet search , the other explanations in decreasing order of likelihood are Hirschsprung 's Disease , botulism , a 30 - foot tapeworm or accidental ingestion of chrysanthemum blossoms . When would you have accidentally eaten chrysanthemum blossoms ? It 's part of an unlikely scenario that involves sleepwalking and a 24 - hour flower mart with a less - than- vigilant proprietor . Oh , Lord , my belly ! Ever had your appendix out ? I have n't . I 've been meaning to , but who has the time ? Let 's get you to the hospital . So this is how it ends ... with cruel irony . Just as I make the commitment to preserving my body , I am betrayed by my appendix , a vestigial organ . Do you know the original purpose of the appendix , Leonard ? No . I do . And yet I 'm doomed while you live on . Funny how things work out , is n't it ? Oh , Lord , I think it 's about to burst ! On the other hand , it might have been the Brussels sprouts . Appendicitis . What a nervous Nelly . Hey , nice knees . They 're my mother 's . Oh . And the Flash shirt is what ? Because , what , you 're gon na run really fast ? No , the Flash shirt is because it 's Friday , but it 's nice when things work out . Where 's your heart rate monitor ? I do n't have one . What about your pedometer ? Do n't have one . Do you have telematics in your shoes connected to an iPod ? Uh , no . What do you do , you just go out there and gambol about like a bunny ? No . I just run till I 'm hungry , then I stop for a bear claw . Why are you doing that ? It 's good to stretch your muscles before you run . All right . All right , let 's start with a toe touch . Okay , you do it . I am doing it . Oh . Wow . Good job . Okay , um , can you do this ? We 'll never know . Okay , let 's just warm up on the run . Okay . Okay , let 's go . I 've been reading up on biomechanics . I think you 'll be surprised at my ... Oh , my God , are you okay ? Oh , let me help you up . Thank you . Oh , Sheldon !

A fitting swan song to your career as a waitress to forget my order one last time . Do you think quitting my job was a mistake ? Do you see me drinking lemonade ? Because Leonard just pissed me off . Am I being an idiot or not ? No , I do n't think you are . The best way to achieve a goal is to devote 100 % of your time and energy to it . When I decided I was going to be a physicist , I did n't take some other job in case it did n't work out . Which was n't easy because there was a lot of pressure from Ms. Pierson for me to be chalk monitor that year . Thank you . I needed to hear that . Why ca n't Leonard understand it ? Because he 's not like us , Penny . We 're dreamers . Yeah , I need to start cracking the window when I leave you in the car . Hey . Hello , Bert . So , anyway , there 's this big , uh , rock and mineral show next week in Santa Monica and ... Listen , um , Bert , before you say anything else , I ... You thought I was gon na ask you to go with me to the mineral show . That 's very nice of you , but ... I do have a boyfriend . That 's what you all say . You just do n't want to go out with me because I have an off - putting personality . My boyfriend has an off - putting personality , too . Like , way worse than you . I mean , I 'm big and weird and funny - looking and no one ever wants to do anything with me . It 's okay . I know I 'm a monster . No , Bert , come on . I 'd love to go to the mineral show with you . Sweet . It 's a date . No , it 's not . Have n't seen this many people in my store since that Korean church bus crashed through my front window . Hey ! Stuart ! Have n't seen you in forever . Look how gray you 've gotten . My hair 's exactly the same color as always . No , I was talking about your skin . Look , uh , my friend here needs a comic book ... Ooh ! And she went into your store by mistake . Good thing there was no one there to see you . What do you need ? Oh , yeah , yeah . I got this . Even you , Sweatpants ? Free popcorn . Can I offer you a coffee ? Espresso ? Latte ? How about you , Stu ? Mocha ? Scone ? Directions to the nearest soup kitchen ? Hey . I 'm just kidding . He knows where the soup kitchen is . It 's on Merton Avenue . I do n't think I like the way you 're treating my friend . You want the book or not ? Not from you . Let 's go , Stuart . You know something , Jesse ? You may have a successful business a - and the kind of pink complexion that comes with good nutrition but I have something more important . Friendship . Which I would trade in a heartbeat for all of this . The mineral and rock show ? That would be awful even without Bert . So what am I supposed to do now ? Prepare your uterus for his gigantic offspring ? I 'm gon na have to tell him the truth : that even if I did n't have a boyfriend , I would n't be interested in him . I 've heard those words so many times . From Linda Nosenchuck , Tammy Rosenworcel ... Padma Kapur , Neha Chowdury Marci Grossman , Lisa Mazzarino ... Megan Pincus ... Tammy Cho ... Oh , who was that girl from our Starbucks ? Arlene Russel ! Arlene ! She wrote \" no way \" on both our cappuccinos . Poor Bert . That guy 's got a rough afternoon ahead of him . Well , how would you want a girl to tell you she was n't interested ? I guess , uh , I 'd like her to sit me down , look me in the eye and say , \" I was wrong . I love you . \" And then maybe she could touch me in a special way . That 's how you reject a guy . Okay , I do n't have time for this . I 'm just gon na go find him and be brutally honest . He 'll be so upset . He 'll probably climb up the Empire State Building and start swatting at planes . You want us to talk to him ? You would do that ? We 've both been in his shoes . We 'll let him down with compassion and respect . So we tell him she 's a lesbian , right ? Of course we tell him she 's a lesbian . And hold three ... two ... one . Now let 's try Warrior II . And hold . I 've read that there are great yogis who have such mastery over their bodies they can draw water in through their genitals . Yeah , well , I do n't think we 're gon na get to do that today . It seems like a good way to drink a milk shake without getting brain freeze . Oh , hey . And now we go to Reverse Warrior . How did she get you to do yoga ? Well , to be honest , I thought she said \" Yoda . \" I 'm helping him relax because , unlike you , he supports me . Oh , how many times do I have to say it ? I support you .\n",

      "Well ... then what if I told you that I added your name to the cable bill ? No . Oh . That 's just as well . They had me on hold for 20 minutes and I hung up . Also , Wolowitz invited us all to dinner , so ... I 'm ready whenever you are . All he had was an idea . Well , that is an important part . Oh , please ! I have ideas all day long . Reverse SeaWorld where dolphins are allowed to pet people . A new clothing size between medium and large called Marge . Snow White retold from the point of view of Sneezy . Why wo n't Doc prescribe him something ? We finally find out . But Leonard 's idea was good . Fine . Then Grumpy-- what 's he so grumpy about ? Maybe his girlfriend wo n't take his side . I 'm the one who thought of it ! Well , did n't he do a lot of the work ? But now he 's happy to let people think he 's responsible for everything . And that 's why you get an iPad helicopter ! Is it my fault I have a much bigger reputation than he does ? Is it my fault that my name came first on the paper alphabetically ? Not your fault . Is it my fault that when the reporter cited me as the lead scientist I did n't correct him ? Hey , look at that pretty bird . He always needs all the attention . He 's such a baby . I swear , he is never ever playing with my helicopter . Okay , I 'll start heating some of this stuff up . This is the boutonniere from my high school prom a piece of cake from my Bar Mitzvah . Did she throw anything away ? If I find my foreskin , I 'm gon na kill myself . Okay , so we 've got , um , three briskets , four meatloafs , one lasagna ... No , that 's noodle kugel . One Jewish lasagna two pound cakes that are about eight pounds each , and one giant container of matzah ball soup . Ma always kept it on hand , in case I got sick . She thought she could cure anything with her cooking . Even the time I got food poisoning . From her cooking . You okay ? Yeah , I 'm okay . Let 's get started . You got it . I 'm never gon na talk to her again . Should we tell everyone not to come ? No . I want to do this . Okay . Well , I 'll keep it together if you can . I 'm not making any promises ! Glad you guys could make it . Wow , it looks really pretty in here . Yeah , turns out half a dozen menorahs really sets a mood . So , Stuart , have you thought about what you 'd do if Howard sells the house ? And there goes the mood . Hi . Oh , and a special hello to Leonard , who needs to be mentioned by name . Subtle . But you got it , right ? Hey , guys . Hey . Hi . Hello . I just want everyone to know , uh , tonight 's not a sad occasion . Yeah , we just want to have the kind of dinner that we 've all had here so many times before . Good food , good friends , and sometime around midnight , heartburn that makes you pray for death . Do you need any help in the kitchen ? No , we got it . You guys make yourselves comfortable . All right , hey , you two , we 're here for Howard right now , okay ? Yes , so please behave yourselves . Fine . So I heard you two , uh , wrote a paper together . How 's that going ? This food is amazing . Mm , and not a vegetable in sight . That 's not true . We 've got tomatoes right here . All these bright people sitting around a table by candlelight . Feels like we could be an 18th century French salon . Indeed . Penny , a salon is a gathering where intellectuals entertained each other with sparkling conversations about issues of the day . Oh , so it 's like The View . Sheldon , The View is a daytime talk show hosted by women . Oh , I 'm aware . It features Whoopi Goldberg . She played Guinan on Star Trek : Next Gen. Penny , Next Gen refers to Star Trek ... I would like to propose a salon topic . Ooh , please do , Rajesh . The lead in The Hunger Games is a woman . Marvel has made \" Tor \" a female . Wait , who 's Tor ? You know , Tor , the God of \" Tunder . \" As I was saying , is this a sign that our society is approaching gender equality ? Certainly a lot more women are reading comic books now . It 's true . At the store , I had to put a seat on the toilet . We wo n't know if there 's equality until female Thor has a baby and the Avengers are cool with her pumping breast milk at work . I wonder if only a baby who is worthy can suckle at the bosom of Thor . Okay , new salon topic . Salons-- dumb thing from a long time ago or interesting thing made dumb by talking about superheroes ? Discuss . I do n't believe it matters what the topic is . What 's crucial for a salon is that we conduct the discussion in an elevated and insightful way . It 's all about the execution . Of course you 'd focus on that rather than the inspiration . Uh , new salon topic . What 's more important , an idea or its execution ? Oh , that 's fun . Yeah , good for you , Leonard . That 's a lovely little notion . Kind of like , \" I wish I could talk to my uncle in Chicago . \" Yeah , now stand back while I invent the telephone . \" Hello ? Oh , hold on . \" Leonard , it 's your uncle . He says you just got burned . You guys . No , it 's okay . We 're all adults trying to have an intelligent discussion . At least I am . Howard , what do you think ? Well , I guess , as an engineer , I lean towards execution . I spend my days trying to take ideas and make them real . Well said , old chap . I thought eloquence had died ; here it stands before us . Starting today , it 'll go : Gettysburg Address , \" I have a dream \" and what you just said . Oh , now he 's a genius ? All you ever do is make fun of him and engineering . Leonard , please . His mother just died . You 're being ridiculous . Yeah , so are you . Guys , if I wanted to hear people be bitchy , I 'd go to my real salon . Leonard , lots of people could 've had that idea , but very few people could 've worked out the math the way I did . Lots of people also did n't have that idea , like everyone in the entire world except for me . Oh , well , apparently Leonard thinks he 's better than everyone in the whole world , including those fighting for our freedom . Yeah , well , I do n't know about you , but I support our boys overseas . And girls . Hey , you already ruined Thor ; give it a rest . So I 'm just supposed to be okay with you hogging all the credit ? ! I did n't hog anything . Unlike you and that weird lasagna with raisins in it . You want some of this ? I 'll give you some . Sheldon , Leonard , living room , right now ! She said my name first ; that must kill you . I do n't know what you think you 're doing , but this is a very difficult time for my husband ! We 're eating the last food his mother ever made , and you were gon na throw it at each other like children ? ! Whatever it is you 're fighting about , put it aside , go back in there and be a good friend to Howard or there 's no dessert for either of you ! Look at me when I 'm talking to you ! And do n't think ... You guys ever notice sometimes Bernadette sounds like my mom ? I do n't hear it . No , not at all . I do n't think I 've eaten that much in my entire life . It 's why my people wandered the desert for 40 years . Took that long to walk it off . You see , Penny , the Israelites were in the desert ... So glad you two are done fighting . Right now , I 'm just trying to burp without throwing up . Physics Today mentioned the paper . What 'd they say ? Who cares ? Did they mention Leonard ? They did . Yay . Good news , I found more Tums . Yay ! Leonard , I 've been working on an opening joke for our lecture at Berkeley . Oh , I like to laugh . But say it anyway . Okay , um ... What do you say to a graduate of the UC Berkeley physics department ? I 'll have fries with that . Because his education has n't prepared him for a career in the sciences . You know , when they chase you out of there , you only have to run faster than Sheldon . Are you all set for your trip ? Yeah , I think so . I just restocked the old PRK . \" PRK \" ? Public restroom kit . Everything a boy needs for making pee pee in new and strange places . I do n't see what 's crazy about bringing a backpack with your own toilet paper and Purell . Keep going . And rubber gloves , uh , air freshener . Um , noise - cancelling headphones . Oh , danger whistle . Um ... pepper spray . Ooh , a multi - language \" occupied \" sign . Uh , let 's see . We have seat protectors , uh , booties for my shoes , a clothespin for my nose . Oh , and a mirror on a stick , so I can make sure the person in the stall next to me is n't some kind of weirdo . You still worried some Berkeley girl is gon na steal him away ? Yes , who do you think gave him the danger whistle ? ♪ Bang ! ♪ Would you like to play a physics car game I invented called \" I Ca n't Spy \" ? It 's all the nail - biting tension of \" I Spy \" but the added fun of subatomic particles and waves outside the visible spectrum . If it 's half as much fun as \" One Times Ten to the Fourth Bottles of Beer on the Wall , \" I 'm in . I 'll begin . Uh , I ca n't spy with my little eye something passing right through us . That soy Frappuccino I had . Will you please play the game ? I ca n't spy with my little eye something passing right through us . I do n't know , um ... If 65 billion solar neutrinos pass through a square centimeter every second , given the surface area of this car is about 60,000 square centimeters , that means 3.9 times ten to the 15th solar neutrinos ? I do n't want to play anymore . We have n't been on a road trip in a while . This is fun . We get it-- you won the game . Stop bragging . No , listen , we wrote a paper together . Now we get to go to a university and talk about it ? That 's pretty cool . I suppose it is . In fact , if you 'd like to celebrate with a little music , I 'd be okay with that . What ... ? This road trip just got crazy . Play that funky music , white boy . I 'm surprised you know that reference . What reference ? So , I put stickers on everything we 're gon na sell . We just need help taking it all out to the driveway . Can I be in charge of pricing ? I 've been going to garage sales my whole life . Can you believe I got these pantyhose for a nickel ? All right , Amy 's in charge of pricing and being 75 . Hey , Penny , can you give me a hand with this ? Aw , we had one of these growing up . I used to play all the time . Oh , yeah ? I love Ping - Pong . Oh , I meant beer pong . I had a table , too , but I did n't have any friends , so all I did was serve . You know , you can leave one side up and play against it . And if I had a friend , they might have told me that . Excuse me . Why is there a sticker on this ? It 's my TARDIS from Doctor Who . I was planning on moving it in the house . I think you just answered your own question . Come on , one day , this may double in value and be worth half what I paid for it . Sweetie , we have a lot to do . We do n't need to decide this right now . Well , I guess as long as you 're keeping an open mind . So ... they 're requesting that the white boy play the funky music , yes ? And this music we 're listening to right now is funky as well ? Let me ask you this . Do you think this song is the music the white boy ultimately plays ? It could be . So it 's like the musical equivalent of Russell 's Paradox , the question of whether the set of all sets that do n't contain themselves as members contains itself ? Exactly . Well ... then I hate it . Music should just be fun . Making great time . Gon na be there pretty early . Will our hotel room be ready ? I doubt it . Are n't you worried that sitting in the lobby for a long period of time might attract the attention of the hotel detective ? If we do , we 'll just tell him to \" hit the bricks , see ? \" Seems a little confrontational , but all right . You know , we wo n't be very far from Skywalker Ranch . Oh , that 's true . It 's not like we can get in there . I - I do n't think George Lucas put his headquarters in the middle of nowhere because he wanted people dropping in . Yoda 's swamp was in the middle of nowhere . Tatooine was in the middle of nowhere . Hoth was in the middle of nowhere . That 's code , Leonard . He wants us to drop in . We do have time . I mean , we could drive by and just look at it . Yes ! Oh ... I 'm so excited . And I just ca n't hide it . \" I 'm about to lose control , and I think I like it . \" What are you talking about ? So when do you guys think you 're gon na move in ? We 're still figuring how much remodeling we want to do . It 's tricky finding the right balance between \" tasteful modern \" and \" Jewish mother tchotchke crapfest . \" Have you made a decision about the TARDIS ? I think I can sell it if we call it , \" Big British Porta - Potty . \" We 're not selling it-- it 's mine . You ca n't just decide . How about I arm - wrestle you ? That 's not fair . It 's like me challenging you to a sexy pants contest . You could play Ping - Pong for it . I would do that . How is that fair ? You grew up with a table . Yes , but I mostly used it as a battlefield in an ongoing war between the Transformers and the ThunderCats for control of a bra I had found in the woods . Bernadette , for every episode of Doctor Who Leonard has made me sit through , I will play on your behalf and send that TARDIS back to Gallifrey , where I hate that I know it belongs . Yes , Penny plays for me . That 's not fair-- she has upper body muscles . Dude , three - time Sanskriti School for Well - Born Boys badminton champion . That 's right-- okay , Raj can play for me . Ooh , you just chose champions . It 's like we 're reenacting the ancient German practice of trial by combat . Yeah , it 's also like when the Mountain fought the Red Viper in Game of Thrones . Leonard makes you watch that , too ? No , no , I like that show . It 's got dragons and people doing it . So it 's settled . The fate of Doctor Who 's TARDIS will be decided by a Game of Thrones inspired death - match on the battlefield of ThunderCats versus Transformers . If you still have that bra , I 'll give you a nickel for it . There it is . It 's just a gate . On a road . Was n't even that hard to find . This is so amazing ! I know ! You want to get a picture ? I want more than a picture . I want to go in . Well , so do I , but they 'll never let us . Is that the attitude that helped you get Penny ? No , but I do n't have three years to make that gate feel sorry for me . Uh , there 's a speaker box . Drive up , push the button , and let 's see what happens . Okay , yeah . What do we have to lose ? I 'm a little nervous . Well , get over it . Confidence is key in these situations . You pushed it-- are you out of your mind ? ! May I help you ? Uh , uh ... we do n't have an appointment , and - and we do n't belong here , but we - we're , like , crazy - big fans . \" crazy for Star Wars \" crazy , not crazy like we have a backpack full of duct tape , although we do have a backpack that you really do n't want to look in . You 're blowing it . We want to meet George Lucas and become his friends and play with him ! This speaker 's not working , just pull up . And that 's how it 's done . All right , we 've defeated the first challenge . Now we must steel ourselves to face the monster who defends the gate . We 're trying to get past a security guard , not rescue Zelda . I think what really needs to be rescued is your sense of whimsy , but one quest at a time . So what 's the plan ? Uh , I 'm just gon na be honest with the guy . Honesty will never get us in . Well , what 's your plan ? All right , my plan is predicated on the assumption that they have a nurse 's office and your willingness to be lightly stabbed . Who are you here to see ? Uh , I 'm just gon na tell you the truth . Oh , you are killing me . We do n't have an appointment . We - we're just fans of Mr. Lucas 's work , and we thought we 'd take a shot and see if we could get in and look around . Sorry , guys , we get this a lot . Ca n't let you in . What if I told you that I was the voice of Yoda ? A recording session I must attend .\n",
