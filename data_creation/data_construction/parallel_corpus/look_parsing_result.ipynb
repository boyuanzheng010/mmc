      "Would have worked better if you told me you were going to the office. See, why don't I believe you? I'm going out for a while. Okay. Doesn't anyone wanna know where he's going? Okay, where is he going? Leonard is going to the office. So how was work today? Busy. I removed an appendix, a gall bladder and about a foot and a half of bowel. I'm hoping that was three different guys. No, just the one. He didn't make it. So how was your day? You know, I'm a physicist, so I thought about stuff. That's it? I wrote some of it down. - Are you done eating? Yeah. Oh, good. If I knew you were waiting, I would have swallowed that lasagna whole. You've reached Dr. Stephanie Barnett. Leave a message. Hey, Steph, it's me again, Howard. If you're free Friday, maybe we could have something to eat at my place. My mom cooks a hell of a brisket. Let me know. It's Howard. I've had her brisket. Melts in your mouth. Mm-hm. Maybe we should think about going to the bedroom. That's a good idea, because there's a bed there, and I'm very, very, very pro-bed.  Hey, it's me again. Just wanna let you know the head count for dinner Friday has gone up. My Aunt Betty and Uncle Elliot are coming in from Palm Springs. Oh, and if anybody should ask, you're half Jewish on your mother's side. Okay, call me. It's Howard. Don't you think you should tell him you're not interested? You want me to stop and call him back right now? Dear God, no.  Hey, it's me again. Howard. Listen, my cousins from Fort Lauderdale are flying in to meet you so that means we're gonna have to move the dinner to a restaurant. MRS. WOLOWITZ : Tell her we're going to the Olive Garden. I have a coupon from the paper.  We're not going to the Olive Garden, Ma. MRS. Oh, Mr. Big-Shot with his Red Lobster. I'll call you back when we firm up the details. It's Howard. Yeah, a couple. Nice. Thank you. So who's the girl? I'm sorry? Well, last time you bought a new shirt was when we were dating. So, what we did was in fact dating? Well, yeah, we did have a date. Exactly. Thank you. Do me a favor, tell Koothrappali that next time you see him. So who is she? Oh, she's a doctor. Oh, nice. A \"doctor\" doctor, or a you kind of doctor? \"Doctor\" doctor. Surgical resident. Smart, pretty. If your friend thinks he's dating someone but he's not, because in fact, you're dating her does that make you a bad person? Well, that depends. On what? Is that friend Wolowitz? Yeah. Screw him, you're fine. Well, have you slept with her yet? You dog. Good for you. Does that change things? No. So why'd you ask? I'm nosy. See you. MRS. WOLOWITZ : Howard, get the door! HOWARD : Is that what you do when someone knocks? Thank you, I had no idea! Hey, buddy. What brings you to my little slice of hell? MRS. Who is it? It's Leonard! MRS. You're gonna have to play outside! I'm not dressed to receive! No one cares, Ma! So, what's up? Listen, I need to talk to you about something.  Hello? Oh, Stephanie, thanks for calling me back. I was worried. Oh. Sure, we can be friends. Absolutely. Thanks for calling. Yeah, you have a nice day too. You are dead to me. Okay, who gets the extra dumpling? Rock, Paper, Scissors, Lizard, Spock. Okay, one of us is going to have to stop putting up Spock. How do we decide that? Rock, Paper, Scissors, Lizard, Spock.  Oh, hey, guys. SHELDON Hey. Hi, Howard. Howard? Sheldon. Howard is employing a schoolyard paradigm in which you are for all intents and purposes deceased. He intends to act on this by not speaking to you feigning an inability to hear you when you speak and otherwise refusing to acknowledge your existence. That's ridiculous. Why are you cooperating with him? I don't make the rules, Leonard. Howard, come on. I didn't plan on this. These things just happen. Usually not to me, but they do happen. Did someone just feel a cold breeze? I believe this is an extension of the death metaphor. The cold breeze is a so-called ectoplasmic issue of a disembodied soul passing by. I'm just gonna eat the dumpling. Come on in. Oh, is this a bad time? Yeah, but I don't see a better one on the horizon, so... Oh, if it isn't Mrs. Dead-To-Me. Hello, Howard. Sheldon? I'm sorry, you violated the terms of your metaphor by acknowledging her existence. I'm out. He just won't listen to me. Okay, well, I guess it'll just be the three of us then. Yeah. Lisa's gonna be disappointed. Yeah. Lisa? Yeah, my roommate. She just went through a bad breakup. I thought she might like to meet somebody fun like you. Leonard, Stephanie, you're alive. It's a miracle. So anyway, Lisa, I just wanted to tell you again how much I enjoyed the other night, and again, I'm sorry for how it ended. But again, if you could let me know about Friday my mother needs a head count so she can know how big a brisket to get. Howard. Look at this. Anyway, call me. It's Howard. It's unclear how the Mars rover got into the crevice but one thing's certain: The data which it has sent back contain the first clear indications that there may have been life on Mars. It's a scientific discovery that has staggering implications for all mankind. Unfortunately, we'll never know who's responsible. Son of a bitch. Hey, sheldon. What is shaking? I'm sorry? It's colloquial, a conversation opener. So, do you find the weather satisfying? Are you currently sharing in the triumph of some local sports team? What's wrong with you? you're freaking me out. I'm striking up a casual conversation with you. S'up? All right, But I'm given to understand that when you have something awkward to discuss with someone, it's more palatable to preface it with banal chit chat. So, this wasn't the awkward part? No. Oh, all right. S'up? Oh, good, I used that right. Anyway, You're aware that leonard has entered into a new Romantic relationship which includes a sexual component? Okay, feeling the awkward now. Her name is dr.Stephanie barnett and she is a highly Distinguished surgical resident at freemont memorial. Yeah, leonard told me. good. What he may have left out is how important this relationship is to me. To you? Yes, see, of the handful of women leonard's been involved with, She's the only one I have ever found tolerable. The statement stands for itself. Well, aren't you sweet? Anyway, should you have any interaction with her, It would be most helpful that she not see you as a sexual rival. Yeah, I think she's pretty safe. You say that now, but consider the following senario you're sitting in your apartment, It's late, you're alone. Your hypothalamus is swimming in a soup of estrogen and Progesterone and suddenly even Leonard seems like a viable sexual candidate. Or a, uh, \"hookup\" As it's referred to by today's urban youth. Really? yes. Now, should that happen, I would ask you to find some way to suppress your libido. I could think about you. Fine, whatever works. Always nice talking to you, sheldon. Uh, peace out! Well, this is very pleasant. Glad you're enjoying yourself. And you said there'd never be enough pasta for the three of us. I stand corrected. You know, italian housewives have a rule of thumb. A handful of dry pasta about an inch in diameter is Sufficient for each person as it doubles in volume when cooked. That's very interesting. Thank you. She doesn't mean it. she's just being nice. Since leonard seems to be dropping the conversational ball, I guess I'll just have to pick it up. Have you ever witnessed a violent crime? No. good. What's your favorite fruit? Uh, strawberries. Hmm, technically not a fruit, but all right. Where did you do your medical internship? Uh, lawrence memorial in galveston, texas. Really? that's where I was born! You're kidding! I spent so much of my childhood at that hospital. When I was 12, I got to ride there in a helicopter. Why, w-w-what happened? Radiation burns. A little mishap while I was building my own cat scanner. I'm sorry, you tried to build your own cat scanner? No, I didn't try, I succeeded. In fact, I was briefly able to see the inside of my sister's guinea pig, Snowball, before he caught fire. It led to an interesting \"not a snowball's chance in a cat scanner.\" Uh, sheldon? Excuse me. When I come back,just for fun, the subject will be alternative history. Specifically, How would the civil war have gone differently If lincoln had been a robot sent from the future? Look at that, there's even pasta left over. Do you understand that this was supposed to be a date? I do. Do you? because frankly, you've been in a foul mood since I sat down. Okay, here's my question. why did you sit down? To help. Look, if you fail at this relationship, and history suggests you will, Then we risk losing the medical officer That our landing party has always needed. What landing party? You're kirk, I'm spock, wolowitz is scotty, Koothrappali is the guy who always gets killed... And now we've got mccoy. We're all standing around looking at the post-op x ray and there it is, Clear as day, right in the guy's chest cavity... One of my earrings. Oh, my god, what did you do? What do you think I did? I discreetly slipped off the other earring, Put it in my pocket and then got the hell out of there! I have a bone to pick with you, sir. Hi, sheldon. Hi, stephanie. I'm sorry I'm late, But yourompanion left the most indecipherable invitation. What invitation? \"we're going to the movies.\" What movie? what theater? what time? If you were trying to make it impossible to locate you, You couldn't have done a better job. Oh, clearly I could have. It took me nearly 20 minutes to go through the browser History on your computer to see what movie times you looked up. Wait here, I'll find us seats. Uh, no, we have seats. Not the right seats. What is he doing? He's finding the acoustic sweet spot. Does he always do this? Sometimes he brings a toy xylophone. I am really sorry about this. No, it's fine. you know, he's sweet. My apologies, you've been sitting in it all along. Leonard, you want to slide over one? No, just sit here. Oh, yeah, this is it. Leonard. Leonard? leonard? ! What, sheldon? What, sheldon? ! Tell me what you see here. The blunt instrument that will be the focus of my murder trial? This is stephanie's facebook page. Now, where it should say \"in a relationship,\" what does it say? \"stephanie barnett is single.\" Yeah, furthermore, earlier this evening, She threw a digital sheep at some guy named mike. Who's mike? ! Why does he get a digital sheep and not you? It's just her facebook page and we've Only been going out a couple of weeks. You don't see it, do you? We're losing her. Okay, I'm going to make this very simple for you. You are not in this relationship. I am. Ergo, you have no say in anything that happens between me and stephanie. I'm afraid I can't allow that. Pursuant to starfleet general order 104 section a, You are deemed unfit and I hereby relieve you of your command. General order 104, section a does not apply in this situation. Give me one good reason why not. Because this is not startrek Penny? Penny? penny? This is banana bread. This is a door knob. It's my understanding that an unsolicited gift of food can Be a precursor to an impromptu invitation to come in and chat. Sheldon, would you like to come in? I suppose I could spare a few minutes. Were you robbed? How can you be sure? Sheldon, what do you want? I'm certain this will come as no surprise to you, But leonard is failing in yet another relationship. He's having problems with stephanie? She's sending virtual livestock to random men on the internet. If I have any hope of keeping them together, I need data. Specifically, I need to know exactly what leonard did that Caused you to pop an emotional cap in his buttocks. Again, urban slang. In which, I believe I'm gaining remarkable fluency. So, what is the \"down\" and the \"low\"? And don't worry, this is all entirely confidential, so, You feel free to include any and all shortcomings in the bedroom. We never got to the bedroom. Because? Oh, okay, all right, you know what? I'll tell you what happened. We were young, we were very much in love, But we could only communicate through a Time-traveling mailbox at my lake house. It's not enough that you made me watch that movie, But now you mock me with it? Gentlemen, I have a question about dating and relationships. You told me you were going to have the talk with him.\n",

But again, if you could let me know about Friday my mother needs a head count so she can know how big a brisket to get. Howard. Look at this. Anyway, call me. It's Howard. It's unclear how the Mars rover got into the crevice but one thing's certain: The data which it has sent back contain the first clear indications that there may have been life on Mars. It's a scientific discovery that has staggering implications for all mankind. Unfortunately, we'll never know who's responsible. Son of a bitch. Hey, sheldon. What is shaking? I'm sorry? It's colloquial, a conversation opener. So, do you find the weather satisfying? Are you currently sharing in the triumph of some local sports team? What's wrong with you? you're freaking me out. I'm striking up a casual conversation with you. S'up? All right, But I'm given to understand that when you have something awkward to discuss with someone, it's more palatable to preface it with banal chit chat. So, this wasn't the awkward part? No. Oh, all right. S'up? Oh, good, I used that right. Anyway, You're aware that leonard has entered into a new Romantic relationship which includes a sexual component? Okay, feeling the awkward now. Her name is dr.Stephanie barnett and she is a highly Distinguished surgical resident at freemont memorial. Yeah, leonard told me. good. What he may have left out is how important this relationship is to me. To you? Yes, see, of the handful of women leonard's been involved with, She's the only one I have ever found tolerable. The statement stands for itself. Well, aren't you sweet? Anyway, should you have any interaction with her, It would be most helpful that she not see you as a sexual rival. Yeah, I think she's pretty safe. You say that now, but consider the following senario you're sitting in your apartment, It's late, you're alone. Your hypothalamus is swimming in a soup of estrogen and Progesterone and suddenly even Leonard seems like a viable sexual candidate. Or a, uh, \"hookup\" As it's referred to by today's urban youth. Really? yes. Now, should that happen, I would ask you to find some way to suppress your libido. I could think about you. Fine, whatever works. Always nice talking to you, sheldon. Uh, peace out! Well, this is very pleasant. Glad you're enjoying yourself. And you said there'd never be enough pasta for the three of us. I stand corrected. You know, italian housewives have a rule of thumb. A handful of dry pasta about an inch in diameter is Sufficient for each person as it doubles in volume when cooked. That's very interesting. Thank you. She doesn't mean it. she's just being nice. Since leonard seems to be dropping the conversational ball, I guess I'll just have to pick it up. Have you ever witnessed a violent crime? No. good. What's your favorite fruit? Uh, strawberries. Hmm, technically not a fruit, but all right. Where did you do your medical internship? Uh, lawrence memorial in galveston, texas. Really? that's where I was born! You're kidding! I spent so much of my childhood at that hospital. When I was 12, I got to ride there in a helicopter. Why, w-w-what happened? Radiation burns. A little mishap while I was building my own cat scanner. I'm sorry, you tried to build your own cat scanner? No, I didn't try, I succeeded. In fact, I was briefly able to see the inside of my sister's guinea pig, Snowball, before he caught fire. It led to an interesting \"not a snowball's chance in a cat scanner.\" Uh, sheldon? Excuse me. When I come back,just for fun, the subject will be alternative history. Specifically, How would the civil war have gone differently If lincoln had been a robot sent from the future? Look at that, there's even pasta left over. Do you understand that this was supposed to be a date? I do. Do you? because frankly, you've been in a foul mood since I sat down. Okay, here's my question. why did you sit down? To help. Look, if you fail at this relationship, and history suggests you will, Then we risk losing the medical officer That our landing party has always needed. What landing party? You're kirk, I'm spock, wolowitz is scotty, Koothrappali is the guy who always gets killed... And now we've got mccoy. We're all standing around looking at the post-op x ray and there it is, Clear as day, right in the guy's chest cavity... One of my earrings. Oh, my god, what did you do? What do you think I did? I discreetly slipped off the other earring, Put it in my pocket and then got the hell out of there! I have a bone to pick with you, sir. Hi, sheldon. Hi, stephanie. I'm sorry I'm late, But yourompanion left the most indecipherable invitation. What invitation? \"we're going to the movies.\" What movie? what theater? what time? If you were trying to make it impossible to locate you, You couldn't have done a better job. Oh, clearly I could have. It took me nearly 20 minutes to go through the browser History on your computer to see what movie times you looked up. Wait here, I'll find us seats. Uh, no, we have seats. Not the right seats. What is he doing? He's finding the acoustic sweet spot. Does he always do this? Sometimes he brings a toy xylophone. I am really sorry about this. No, it's fine. you know, he's sweet. My apologies, you've been sitting in it all along. Leonard, you want to slide over one? No, just sit here. Oh, yeah, this is it. Leonard. Leonard? leonard? ! What, sheldon? What, sheldon? ! Tell me what you see here. The blunt instrument that will be the focus of my murder trial? This is stephanie's facebook page. Now, where it should say \"in a relationship,\" what does it say? \"stephanie barnett is single.\" Yeah, furthermore, earlier this evening, She threw a digital sheep at some guy named mike. Who's mike? ! Why does he get a digital sheep and not you? It's just her facebook page and we've Only been going out a couple of weeks. You don't see it, do you? We're losing her. Okay, I'm going to make this very simple for you. You are not in this relationship. I am. Ergo, you have no say in anything that happens between me and stephanie. I'm afraid I can't allow that. Pursuant to starfleet general order 104 section a, You are deemed unfit and I hereby relieve you of your command. General order 104, section a does not apply in this situation. Give me one good reason why not. Because this is not startrek Penny? Penny? penny? This is banana bread. This is a door knob. It's my understanding that an unsolicited gift of food can Be a precursor to an impromptu invitation to come in and chat. Sheldon, would you like to come in? I suppose I could spare a few minutes. Were you robbed? How can you be sure? Sheldon, what do you want? I'm certain this will come as no surprise to you, But leonard is failing in yet another relationship. He's having problems with stephanie? She's sending virtual livestock to random men on the internet. If I have any hope of keeping them together, I need data. Specifically, I need to know exactly what leonard did that Caused you to pop an emotional cap in his buttocks. Again, urban slang. In which, I believe I'm gaining remarkable fluency. So, what is the \"down\" and the \"low\"? And don't worry, this is all entirely confidential, so, You feel free to include any and all shortcomings in the bedroom. We never got to the bedroom. Because? Oh, okay, all right, you know what? I'll tell you what happened. We were young, we were very much in love, But we could only communicate through a Time-traveling mailbox at my lake house. It's not enough that you made me watch that movie, But now you mock me with it? Gentlemen, I have a question about dating and relationships. You told me you were going to have the talk with him.\n",

      "Would have worked better if you told me you were going to the office. See, why don't I believe you? I'm going out for a while. Okay. Doesn't anyone wanna know where he's going? Okay, where is he going? Leonard is going to the office. So how was work today? Busy. I removed an appendix, a gall bladder and about a foot and a half of bowel. I'm hoping that was three different guys. No, just the one. He didn't make it. So how was your day? You know, I'm a physicist, so I thought about stuff. That's it? I wrote some of it down. - Are you done eating? Yeah. Oh, good. If I knew you were waiting, I would have swallowed that lasagna whole. You've reached Dr. Stephanie Barnett. Leave a message. Hey, Steph, it's me again, Howard. If you're free Friday, maybe we could have something to eat at my place. My mom cooks a hell of a brisket. Let me know. It's Howard. I've had her brisket. Melts in your mouth. Mm-hm. Maybe we should think about going to the bedroom. That's a good idea, because there's a bed there, and I'm very, very, very pro-bed.  Hey, it's me again. Just wanna let you know the head count for dinner Friday has gone up. My Aunt Betty and Uncle Elliot are coming in from Palm Springs. Oh, and if anybody should ask, you're half Jewish on your mother's side. Okay, call me. It's Howard. Don't you think you should tell him you're not interested? You want me to stop and call him back right now? Dear God, no.  Hey, it's me again. Howard. Listen, my cousins from Fort Lauderdale are flying in to meet you so that means we're gonna have to move the dinner to a restaurant. MRS. WOLOWITZ : Tell her we're going to the Olive Garden. I have a coupon from the paper.  We're not going to the Olive Garden, Ma. MRS. Oh, Mr. Big-Shot with his Red Lobster. I'll call you back when we firm up the details. It's Howard. Yeah, a couple. Nice. Thank you. So who's the girl? I'm sorry? Well, last time you bought a new shirt was when we were dating. So, what we did was in fact dating? Well, yeah, we did have a date. Exactly. Thank you. Do me a favor, tell Koothrappali that next time you see him. So who is she? Oh, she's a doctor. Oh, nice. A \"doctor\" doctor, or a you kind of doctor? \"Doctor\" doctor. Surgical resident. Smart, pretty. If your friend thinks he's dating someone but he's not, because in fact, you're dating her does that make you a bad person? Well, that depends. On what? Is that friend Wolowitz? Yeah. Screw him, you're fine. Well, have you slept with her yet? You dog. Good for you. Does that change things? No. So why'd you ask? I'm nosy. See you. MRS. WOLOWITZ : Howard, get the door! HOWARD : Is that what you do when someone knocks? Thank you, I had no idea! Hey, buddy. What brings you to my little slice of hell? MRS. Who is it? It's Leonard! MRS. You're gonna have to play outside! I'm not dressed to receive! No one cares, Ma! So, what's up? Listen, I need to talk to you about something.  Hello? Oh, Stephanie, thanks for calling me back. I was worried. Oh. Sure, we can be friends. Absolutely. Thanks for calling. Yeah, you have a nice day too. You are dead to me. Okay, who gets the extra dumpling? Rock, Paper, Scissors, Lizard, Spock. Okay, one of us is going to have to stop putting up Spock. How do we decide that? Rock, Paper, Scissors, Lizard, Spock.  Oh, hey, guys. SHELDON Hey. Hi, Howard. Howard? Sheldon. Howard is employing a schoolyard paradigm in which you are for all intents and purposes deceased. He intends to act on this by not speaking to you feigning an inability to hear you when you speak and otherwise refusing to acknowledge your existence. That's ridiculous. Why are you cooperating with him? I don't make the rules, Leonard. Howard, come on. I didn't plan on this. These things just happen. Usually not to me, but they do happen. Did someone just feel a cold breeze? I believe this is an extension of the death metaphor. The cold breeze is a so-called ectoplasmic issue of a disembodied soul passing by. I'm just gonna eat the dumpling. Come on in. Oh, is this a bad time? Yeah, but I don't see a better one on the horizon, so... Oh, if it isn't Mrs. Dead-To-Me. Hello, Howard. Sheldon? I'm sorry, you violated the terms of your metaphor by acknowledging her existence. I'm out. He just won't listen to me. Okay, well, I guess it'll just be the three of us then. Yeah. Lisa's gonna be disappointed. Yeah. Lisa? Yeah, my roommate. She just went through a bad breakup. I thought she might like to meet somebody fun like you. Leonard, Stephanie, you're alive.

Remember your little fling with Brittany and Santana? I do... all right? Let's face it, Finn... The only way that this relationship is going to work is if we're both losers. Okay. This is how it's gonna happen: I'm going to be quarterback again, then I'm going to throw a touchdown in our first game, and then point to you in the stands so that everybody in the school knows you're my girlfriend. All right? That's very romantic, but... Rachel, you can't ask me to choose between you and football. Well, I am. It's so, so exciting! You know, I can get you backstage if you want. You're all dressed up. You look like a cast member of Kids Incorporated. Well, I really want to loosen up a bit, so I'm, uh, helping the kids do Britney. Outrageous, right? Showtime. Sit down! There's nothing to stand up and cheer about. Hey, Coach! The glee club's doing Britney Spears for the assembly. I just found out. Becky, you're on red alert.

You know, William, that's what one Hubert Humphrey said back in 1968 at the start of the Democratic National Convention. But then hippies put acid in everyone's bourbon. And when an updraft revealed Lady Bird Johnson's tramp stamp and tattoos above her ovaries, Mayor Richard J. Daley became so incensed with sexual rage that he punched his own wife in the face and spent the next hour screaming \"Sex party\" into the microphones of all three major networks. Okay, I'm pretty sure none of that happened. You can expect a call very soon from my lawyer... Gloria Allred. I'm gonna sue the pants off you, Will. I'm gonna take your house, your car, your extensive collection of vests. I mean, seriously, you wear more vests than the cast of Blossom. And I'll see you in court. Emma... Look, what I did was a little weird. I know that. It was inappropriate for me to do Britney with the kids. I just thought you wanted me to be less uptight. Will, I just wanted you to relax. You know, not stop being you. You know, Terri's still on your case, you lost at regionals, Glee's still the bottom pickle in the barrel... You and Carl. Yeah. Me and Carl. Especially me and Carl. Look, have you ever noticed that Britney Spears only makes great music when she's not chasing down paparazzi? She can't just swallow a grenade and let her talent explode all over the wall. She's got to rein it in, just like you do. You're such a great teacher, Will. No, probably the best in the whole school. So why would you want to be someone else when the someone that you already are is so amazing? Because the boring someone I already am... wasn't good enough for you. Hey, where you going? To return that car. U.S. History... Crap, I forgot I was taking that. Congrats, Finn. You're back on the team, I'm head cheerleader again. Some kind of symmetry, don't you think? With all the nastiness between you and I behind us, I think we should be together. We'd be a shoo-in for Homecoming king and queen. So what do you say? You and me, 8:00, Breadstix? Look, I'd be lying if I said I didn't have feelings for you. Probably always will. But I'm not gonna get back together with you. There's someone else, and you know who that is. I'm asking you to respect that. I said what you wanted me to, he shot me down. So congrats. Looks like he really loves you. I have a song that I've prepared for the class. Sorry, Rachel, no Britney. I'm really happy that her music has inspired so many of you, even if that inspiration was brought about by a dangerous narcotic. And I think we've all come to appreciate her music and celebrity so much more this week. But honestly, she's just not us. I'm devastated. I can't believe we only did one Britney number. I was actually gonna do something from our original assignment last week: Adult Contemporary. But this is just a little bit more Young Adult. Great, Rachel. Well, let's hear it. I'd like to dedicate this song to my boyfriend, Finn. I shouldn't try to control you. I've never been this happy before. And I realize that I was trying to hold onto how you were making me feel so much, that I was strangling you in my hands, like a little bird. I get now, that in order for this relationship to work, I have to open up my hands and let you fly free. Finn can fly? Really? Wait, I thought I was the only one getting the solos from now on.

I just wasn't sure of the proper protocol now that you and Leonard are no longer having coitus. God, can we please just say \"no longer seeing each other\"? Well, we could if it were true. But as you live in the same building, you see each other all the time. The variable which has changed is the coitus. Okay, here's the protocol: you and I are still friends, and you stop saying \"coitus.\" Good, good. I'm glad we're still friends. Really? Oh, yes. It was a lot of work to accommodate you in my life. I'd hate for that effort to have been in vain. Right. Just to be clear, do I have to stop saying \"coitus\" with everyone or just you? Harsh terms. But all right- I'll just substitute \"intercourse.\" Great. Or \"fornication.\" But that has judgmental overtones, so I'll hold that in reserve. So, how you been? Well, my existence is a continuum, so I've been what I am at each point in the implied time period. You're just coitusing with me, aren't you? Bazinga. How's Leonard doing? He seems all right. Although he does spend a disturbing amount of time looking at photographs of you and smelling the pillow you slept on. Oh, but now that I think of it, he asked me not to tell you that. I'll pretend I didn't hear it. I'd rather you pretend I didn't say it. I see you bought Mama Italia marinara spaghetti sauce. Yep. That's the sauce my mother uses. She likes cooking Italian because according to her, that's what the Romans made Jesus eat. I'll have to have you over for spaghetti some night. I'm hungry now. Oh. Um, okay. Why don't you give me an hour and come over? Will you cut up hot dogs into little chunks and mix them in with the sauce? I don't have hot dogs. Oh, it's all right; I do. Oh! You're in for what my mother calls \"a real Eye-talian treat\"\" Hey, where you been? I was talking with Penny. What's wrong with you? You can't hang out with your roommate's ex. That's totally uncool. No, it's fine. I don't care. I'm over it. Yeah, he's over it; that's why he's been whining all day about trying to invent that memory-wiper gizmo from Men in Black. Is he making any progress? Because I'd like to erase Ben Affleck as Daredevil. So would Ben Affleck. The point is, in a situation like this you got to pick sides. You're either on Team Leonard or Team Penny. Which one picks last? Well, usually I'm on the team that picks last. Unless there's a kid in a wheelchair. Sheldon, I got you your tangerine chicken. I hope you're hungry. Well, of course I'm hungry. And as I have no plans to eat with any other team, I will consume my tangerine chicken with the appropriate gusto. Just out of curiosity, do we still have hot dogs? I don't know. Why? Just making dinner conversation. Go, Team Leonard! ♪ The autotrophs began to drool, Neanderthals developed tools ♪ ♪ We built the Wall ♪ ♪ We built the pyramids ♪ ♪ Math, Science, History, unraveling the mystery ♪ ♪ That all started with a big bang ♪ ♪ Bang! Oh, God, this is good. Let me ask you a question. Do you believe you're going to go to hell for eating sweet and sour pork? Jews don't have hell. We have acid reflux. Do you want the last dumpling, Sheldon? Certainly. It's not like I have to moderate my food intake because I'm planning on eating again very shortly. So, you guys want to do something tonight? Nah, I can't. I got to pick up my mom from her water aerobics class. 18 overweight women flapping their arm fat in a swimming pool. Looks like the manatee tank at Sea World. What about you, Raj? Oh, there it is: now that you don't have a girlfriend, you want to hang out with me again. I never stopped hanging out with you. Oh, please, we all know I'm the friend you call when you have no other options. If we were the Justice League, I'd be Aquaman. I wish you were Aquaman. Then I could send you to scoop my mom out of the old lady tank. Excuse me, I'm thirsty, so I'm going to go to the refrigerator and get myself a refreshing beverage. I'll just spend the evening alone. What, suddenly I'm not good enough for you? I do so love beverages. Now I think I'll take my after-dinner walk. Since when do you take after-dinner walks? Yeah, since when do you take walks? I read a study online that walking after a meal not only aids in digestion, but increases serotonin, and you know me, if there's one thing I like more than a refreshing beverage, it's serotonin. Bye-bye. Hold on. I'll walk down with you. Oh... that's not necessary. Or we could go together. I can't think of a reason why not. Let's go. Hold on. Nope, no reason. I've missed you. All right, say hello to your mother for me. You said you were going for a walk. I didn't say outside. So what, you're just gonna walk up and down the stairs? That would be odd and suspicious behavior. Here, Russell! Here, boy! Which way are you going? Which way are you going? I parked my scooter down the block. I'm going the other way. Bye. Actually, I'm this way. Do I smell hot dogs? No. I mean, I have no idea what you smell. I definitely smell raw hot dog. Perhaps you're getting a brain tumor. All right, have a nice walk. I shall. Have a nice scoot. You might want to stand back. I'm sitting on top of 13 horses here. Hello, doggie. Nice doggie. I bet you think you smell hot dogs. Look, a cat! SHELDON Penny? Penny. I had to trade the others for my life. Hey, Leonard? Yeah? I haven't had sex in a year. Where you going with this, Raj? Don't flatter yourself, dude. I want to go out and meet a woman. So, go. Well, I need a wingman. I don't want to come off like a lonely loser. And you think my presence will help with that? Well, I do. Next to you, I'll look like a catch. I'm not going out tonight, Raj. Would you mind if I went to your room and downloaded some Asian pornography? Very much. Doesn't have to be Asian. Don't worry. You'll meet a girl someday. No, I won't. Yes, you will, and she'll be beautiful. And kind and sexy and funny and everything you ever wanted in a woman. You really think so? I do, and you'll fall hopelessly in love and give her your heart. And she'll take it and grind it into pathetic, little pieces. But we'll have sex first, right? That's Eye-talian. So, um, was Leonard okay with you coming over? Oh, yes. In fact, he said, \"I'm fine. I don't care.\" And he in no way said it in a manner which would lead one to believe that he was covering up feelings of anguish and betrayal. Well, good. I'm also pleased to report that he's all cried out over you. He's been crying? Oh, I believe that was something else I wasn't supposed to mention. Oh, God, I feel terrible. Do you have a stomachache, too? No. Why, do you? Why did you ask if I had one, too? Just making polite dinner conversation. Your turn. All right. So, what's new in your life? Well, my new shoes are not made for running. Have you been running? No. It's just a suspicion I have. I'm so glad you like it. I do. Leonard never cooks for me. Well, maybe that's 'cause Leonard can't cook. You can't cook and you made me this. Ooh, I'm gonna get the cheesecake out of the fridge. Oh, Lord, I'm in Jewish hell. Look at this. Do you think she's really doing that or is it PhotoShop? I'm pretty sure Martha Stewart never got naked with a room full of big, fat Japanese guys. You don't know that. Prison changes people. I told you, walking. For an hour and a half? I got lost. How could you get lost? Your phone has GPS. Satellites are down. Solar flares. There are no solar flares right now. Yes, there are. Dude, I'm an astrophysicist. If there were solar flares, I'd be all up in it. I'm sorry. I misspoke. What I meant to say was my battery died. What the hell was that about? Do you think this is really Hillary Clinton doing it with Oprah? Oh, we really need to get you a girl. SHELDON Leonard. Leonard. Leonard. Oh, just come in! Thanks for seeing me on such short notice. What do you want, Sheldon? Maybe this isn't a good time. Tell me why you woke me up or I swear to God I will kill you. Do you really think death threats are an appropriate way to begin this conversation? Sometimes your lack of social skills astonishes me. You may want to sit down. I'm in bed! Point taken. You may want to sit up. I've been seeing Penny behind your back. When you say \"seeing Penny, \" what exactly does that mean? We had dinner last night. She made me spaghetti with little hot dogs cut up in it. Well, little hot dog. I gave up the other five hot dogs to a real dog. A real, big dog. A hell hound. Tangential to the primary story. How about I circle back to it? Why did you have dinner with Penny? I told you, she made spaghetti with little hot dogs. I like spaghetti with little hot dogs. Then why did you have Chinese food with us? I didn't want to upset you. Howard made it very clear that my allegiance should be to male comrades before women who sell their bodies for money. Is it possible he said, \"Bros before hos\"? Yes, but I rephrased it to avoid offending the hos. Sheldon, I don't care if you want to be friends with Penny. Oh. Well, so the emotional turmoil that's been keeping me from achieving REM sleep was entirely unjustified? Yes. Well... then as my meemaw would say, \"Looks like we butchered a pig, but nobody wanted bacon.\" And now, as promised, the tangent. Sheldon and the Hell Hound. Or How I Lost My Hot Dogs. Oh, um... I, I can come back. D-don't be silly. We're neighbors. We're going to run into each other. May as well get used to it. Yeah, I guess you're right. You used to it yet? Nope. Me neither. Oh, Sheldon seemed tthink that I would be upset about you hanging out with him. But I just want you to know it's fine. Oh, oh, good, because, um, his mother called me.\n",

Don't you want to make me feel safe and happy, too? Well, yeah. Yeah, sure. Do you want me to quit football? Look, how am I supposed to trust that you're not just going to stray again? Remember your little fling with Brittany and Santana? I do... all right? Let's face it, Finn... The only way that this relationship is going to work is if we're both losers. Okay. This is how it's gonna happen: I'm going to be quarterback again, then I'm going to throw a touchdown in our first game, and then point to you in the stands so that everybody in the school knows you're my girlfriend. All right? That's very romantic, but... Rachel, you can't ask me to choose between you and football. Well, I am. It's so, so exciting! You know, I can get you backstage if you want. You're all dressed up. You look like a cast member of Kids Incorporated. Well, I really want to loosen up a bit, so I'm, uh, helping the kids do Britney. Outrageous, right? Showtime. Sit down! There's nothing to stand up and cheer about. Hey, Coach! The glee club's doing Britney Spears for the assembly. I just found out. Becky, you're on red alert. If you see any awkward teenage frottage, you perform that citizen's arrest we practiced. Got it, Coach. Quiet, please, children. Quiet now. First, students who ate the ravioli today and are not up-to-date on their tetanus shots should see the nurse immediately. Welcome to our homecoming pep assembly.

You know, William, that's what one Hubert Humphrey said back in 1968 at the start of the Democratic National Convention. But then hippies put acid in everyone's bourbon. And when an updraft revealed Lady Bird Johnson's tramp stamp and tattoos above her ovaries, Mayor Richard J. Daley became so incensed with sexual rage that he punched his own wife in the face and spent the next hour screaming \"Sex party\" into the microphones of all three major networks. Okay, I'm pretty sure none of that happened. You can expect a call very soon from my lawyer... Gloria Allred. I'm gonna sue the pants off you, Will. I'm gonna take your house, your car, your extensive collection of vests. I mean, seriously, you wear more vests than the cast of Blossom. And I'll see you in court. Emma... Look, what I did was a little weird. I know that. It was inappropriate for me to do Britney with the kids. I just thought you wanted me to be less uptight. Will, I just wanted you to relax. You know, not stop being you. You know, Terri's still on your case, you lost at regionals, Glee's still the bottom pickle in the barrel... You and Carl. Yeah. Me and Carl. Especially me and Carl. Look, have you ever noticed that Britney Spears only makes great music when she's not chasing down paparazzi? She can't just swallow a grenade and let her talent explode all over the wall. She's got to rein it in, just like you do. You're such a great teacher, Will. No, probably the best in the whole school. So why would you want to be someone else when the someone that you already are is so amazing? Because the boring someone I already am... wasn't good enough for you. Hey, where you going? To return that car. U.S. History... Crap, I forgot I was taking that. Congrats, Finn. You're back on the team, I'm head cheerleader again. Some kind of symmetry, don't you think? With all the nastiness between you and I behind us, I think we should be together. We'd be a shoo-in for Homecoming king and queen. So what do you say? You and me, 8:00, Breadstix? Look, I'd be lying if I said I didn't have feelings for you. Probably always will. But I'm not gonna get back together with you. There's someone else, and you know who that is. I'm asking you to respect that. I said what you wanted me to, he shot me down. So congrats. Looks like he really loves you. I have a song that I've prepared for the class. Sorry, Rachel, no Britney. I'm really happy that her music has inspired so many of you, even if that inspiration was brought about by a dangerous narcotic. And I think we've all come to appreciate her music and celebrity so much more this week. But honestly, she's just not us. I'm devastated. I can't believe we only did one Britney number. I was actually gonna do something from our original assignment last week: Adult Contemporary. But this is just a little bit more Young Adult. Great, Rachel. Well, let's hear it. I'd like to dedicate this song to my boyfriend, Finn. I shouldn't try to control you. I've never been this happy before. And I realize that I was trying to hold onto how you were making me feel so much, that I was strangling you in my hands, like a little bird. I get now, that in order for this relationship to work, I have to open up my hands and let you fly free. Finn can fly? Really? Wait, I thought I was the only one getting the solos from now on.

Oh, yay, a new MasterCard! Uh-oh. What? I was going to get my mail. Okay. Are... are you hoping to get it telepathically? I think you mean telekinetically. And no. I just wasn't sure of the proper protocol now that you and Leonard are no longer having coitus. God, can we please just say \"no longer seeing each other\"? Well, we could if it were true. But as you live in the same building, you see each other all the time. The variable which has changed is the coitus. Okay, here's the protocol: you and I are still friends, and you stop saying \"coitus.\" Good, good. I'm glad we're still friends. Really? Oh, yes. It was a lot of work to accommodate you in my life. I'd hate for that effort to have been in vain. Right. Just to be clear, do I have to stop saying \"coitus\" with everyone or just you? Harsh terms. But all right- I'll just substitute \"intercourse.\" Great. Or \"fornication.\" But that has judgmental overtones, so I'll hold that in reserve. So, how you been? Well, my existence is a continuum, so I've been what I am at each point in the implied time period. You're just coitusing with me, aren't you? Bazinga. How's Leonard doing? He seems all right. Although he does spend a disturbing amount of time looking at photographs of you and smelling the pillow you slept on. Oh, but now that I think of it, he asked me not to tell you that. I'll pretend I didn't hear it. I'd rather you pretend I didn't say it. I see you bought Mama Italia marinara spaghetti sauce. Yep. That's the sauce my mother uses. She likes cooking Italian because according to her, that's what the Romans made Jesus eat. I'll have to have you over for spaghetti some night. I'm hungry now. Oh. Um, okay. Why don't you give me an hour and come over? Will you cut up hot dogs into little chunks and mix them in with the sauce? I don't have hot dogs. Oh, it's all right; I do. Oh! You're in for what my mother calls \"a real Eye-talian treat\"\" Hey, where you been? I was talking with Penny. What's wrong with you? You can't hang out with your roommate's ex. That's totally uncool. No, it's fine. I don't care. I'm over it. Yeah, he's over it; that's why he's been whining all day about trying to invent that memory-wiper gizmo from Men in Black. Is he making any progress? Because I'd like to erase Ben Affleck as Daredevil. So would Ben Affleck. The point is, in a situation like this you got to pick sides. You're either on Team Leonard or Team Penny. Which one picks last? Well, usually I'm on the team that picks last. Unless there's a kid in a wheelchair. Sheldon, I got you your tangerine chicken. I hope you're hungry. Well, of course I'm hungry. And as I have no plans to eat with any other team, I will consume my tangerine chicken with the appropriate gusto. Just out of curiosity, do we still have hot dogs? I don't know. Why? Just making dinner conversation. Go, Team Leonard! ♪ The autotrophs began to drool, Neanderthals developed tools ♪ ♪ We built the Wall ♪ ♪ We built the pyramids ♪ ♪ Math, Science, History, unraveling the mystery ♪ ♪ That all started with a big bang ♪ ♪ Bang! Oh, God, this is good. Let me ask you a question. Do you believe you're going to go to hell for eating sweet and sour pork? Jews don't have hell. We have acid reflux. Do you want the last dumpling, Sheldon? Certainly. It's not like I have to moderate my food intake because I'm planning on eating again very shortly. So, you guys want to do something tonight? Nah, I can't. I got to pick up my mom from her water aerobics class. 18 overweight women flapping their arm fat in a swimming pool. Looks like the manatee tank at Sea World. What about you, Raj? Oh, there it is: now that you don't have a girlfriend, you want to hang out with me again. I never stopped hanging out with you. Oh, please, we all know I'm the friend you call when you have no other options. If we were the Justice League, I'd be Aquaman. I wish you were Aquaman. Then I could send you to scoop my mom out of the old lady tank. Excuse me, I'm thirsty, so I'm going to go to the refrigerator and get myself a refreshing beverage. I'll just spend the evening alone. What, suddenly I'm not good enough for you? I do so love beverages. Now I think I'll take my after-dinner walk. Since when do you take after-dinner walks? Yeah, since when do you take walks? I read a study online that walking after a meal not only aids in digestion, but increases serotonin, and you know me, if there's one thing I like more than a refreshing beverage, it's serotonin. Bye-bye. Hold on. I'll walk down with you. Oh... that's not necessary. Or we could go together. I can't think of a reason why not. Let's go. Hold on. Nope, no reason. I've missed you. All right, say hello to your mother for me. You said you were going for a walk. I didn't say outside. So what, you're just gonna walk up and down the stairs? That would be odd and suspicious behavior. Here, Russell! Here, boy! Which way are you going? Which way are you going? I parked my scooter down the block. I'm going the other way. Bye. Actually, I'm this way. Do I smell hot dogs? No. I mean, I have no idea what you smell. I definitely smell raw hot dog. Perhaps you're getting a brain tumor. All right, have a nice walk. I shall. Have a nice scoot. You might want to stand back. I'm sitting on top of 13 horses here. Hello, doggie. Nice doggie. I bet you think you smell hot dogs. Look, a cat! SHELDON Penny? Penny. I had to trade the others for my life. Hey, Leonard? Yeah? I haven't had sex in a year. Where you going with this, Raj? Don't flatter yourself, dude. I want to go out and meet a woman. So, go. Well, I need a wingman. I don't want to come off like a lonely loser. And you think my presence will help with that? Well, I do. Next to you, I'll look like a catch. I'm not going out tonight, Raj. Would you mind if I went to your room and downloaded some Asian pornography? Very much. Doesn't have to be Asian. Don't worry. You'll meet a girl someday. No, I won't. Yes, you will, and she'll be beautiful. And kind and sexy and funny and everything you ever wanted in a woman. You really think so? I do, and you'll fall hopelessly in love and give her your heart. And she'll take it and grind it into pathetic, little pieces. But we'll have sex first, right? That's Eye-talian. So, um, was Leonard okay with you coming over? Oh, yes. In fact, he said, \"I'm fine. I don't care.\" And he in no way said it in a manner which would lead one to believe that he was covering up feelings of anguish and betrayal. Well, good.

Okay, here's the protocol: you and I are still friends, and you stop saying \"coitus.\" Good, good. I'm glad we're still friends. Really? Oh, yes. It was a lot of work to accommodate you in my life. I'd hate for that effort to have been in vain. Right. Just to be clear, do I have to stop saying \"coitus\" with everyone or just you? Harsh terms. But all right- I'll just substitute \"intercourse.\" Great. Or \"fornication.\" But that has judgmental overtones, so I'll hold that in reserve. So, how you been? Well, my existence is a continuum, so I've been what I am at each point in the implied time period. You're just coitusing with me, aren't you? Bazinga. How's Leonard doing? He seems all right. Although he does spend a disturbing amount of time looking at photographs of you and smelling the pillow you slept on. Oh, but now that I think of it, he asked me not to tell you that. I'll pretend I didn't hear it. I'd rather you pretend I didn't say it. I see you bought Mama Italia marinara spaghetti sauce. Yep. That's the sauce my mother uses. She likes cooking Italian because according to her, that's what the Romans made Jesus eat. I'll have to have you over for spaghetti some night. I'm hungry now. Oh. Um, okay. Why don't you give me an hour and come over? Will you cut up hot dogs into little chunks and mix them in with the sauce? I don't have hot dogs. Oh, it's all right; I do. Oh! You're in for what my mother calls \"a real Eye-talian treat\"\" Hey, where you been? I was talking with Penny. What's wrong with you? You can't hang out with your roommate's ex. That's totally uncool. No, it's fine. I don't care. I'm over it. Yeah, he's over it; that's why he's been whining all day about trying to invent that memory-wiper gizmo from Men in Black. Is he making any progress? Because I'd like to erase Ben Affleck as Daredevil. So would Ben Affleck. The point is, in a situation like this you got to pick sides. You're either on Team Leonard or Team Penny. Which one picks last? Well, usually I'm on the team that picks last. Unless there's a kid in a wheelchair. Sheldon, I got you your tangerine chicken. I hope you're hungry. Well, of course I'm hungry. And as I have no plans to eat with any other team, I will consume my tangerine chicken with the appropriate gusto. Just out of curiosity, do we still have hot dogs? I don't know. Why? Just making dinner conversation. Go, Team Leonard! ♪ The autotrophs began to drool, Neanderthals developed tools ♪ ♪ We built the Wall ♪ ♪ We built the pyramids ♪ ♪ Math, Science, History, unraveling the mystery ♪ ♪ That all started with a big bang ♪ ♪ Bang! Oh, God, this is good. Let me ask you a question. Do you believe you're going to go to hell for eating sweet and sour pork? Jews don't have hell. We have acid reflux. Do you want the last dumpling, Sheldon? Certainly. It's not like I have to moderate my food intake because I'm planning on eating again very shortly. So, you guys want to do something tonight? Nah, I can't. I got to pick up my mom from her water aerobics class. 18 overweight women flapping their arm fat in a swimming pool. Looks like the manatee tank at Sea World. What about you, Raj? Oh, there it is: now that you don't have a girlfriend, you want to hang out with me again. I never stopped hanging out with you. Oh, please, we all know I'm the friend you call when you have no other options. If we were the Justice League, I'd be Aquaman. I wish you were Aquaman. Then I could send you to scoop my mom out of the old lady tank. Excuse me, I'm thirsty, so I'm going to go to the refrigerator and get myself a refreshing beverage. I'll just spend the evening alone. What, suddenly I'm not good enough for you? I do so love beverages. Now I think I'll take my after-dinner walk. Since when do you take after-dinner walks? Yeah, since when do you take walks? I read a study online that walking after a meal not only aids in digestion, but increases serotonin, and you know me, if there's one thing I like more than a refreshing beverage, it's serotonin. Bye-bye. Hold on. I'll walk down with you. Oh... that's not necessary. Or we could go together. I can't think of a reason why not. Let's go. Hold on. Nope, no reason. I've missed you. All right, say hello to your mother for me. You said you were going for a walk. I didn't say outside. So what, you're just gonna walk up and down the stairs? That would be odd and suspicious behavior. Here, Russell! Here, boy! Which way are you going? Which way are you going? I parked my scooter down the block. I'm going the other way. Bye. Actually, I'm this way. Do I smell hot dogs? No. I mean, I have no idea what you smell. I definitely smell raw hot dog. Perhaps you're getting a brain tumor. All right, have a nice walk. I shall. Have a nice scoot. You might want to stand back. I'm sitting on top of 13 horses here. Hello, doggie. Nice doggie. I bet you think you smell hot dogs. Look, a cat! SHELDON Penny? Penny. I had to trade the others for my life. Hey, Leonard? Yeah? I haven't had sex in a year. Where you going with this, Raj? Don't flatter yourself, dude. I want to go out and meet a woman. So, go. Well, I need a wingman. I don't want to come off like a lonely loser. And you think my presence will help with that? Well, I do. Next to you, I'll look like a catch. I'm not going out tonight, Raj. Would you mind if I went to your room and downloaded some Asian pornography? Very much. Doesn't have to be Asian. Don't worry. You'll meet a girl someday. No, I won't. Yes, you will, and she'll be beautiful. And kind and sexy and funny and everything you ever wanted in a woman. You really think so? I do, and you'll fall hopelessly in love and give her your heart. And she'll take it and grind it into pathetic, little pieces. But we'll have sex first, right? That's Eye-talian. So, um, was Leonard okay with you coming over? Oh, yes. In fact, he said, \"I'm fine. I don't care.\" And he in no way said it in a manner which would lead one to believe that he was covering up feelings of anguish and betrayal. Well, good. I'm also pleased to report that he's all cried out over you. He's been crying? Oh, I believe that was something else I wasn't supposed to mention. Oh, God, I feel terrible. Do you have a stomachache, too? No. Why, do you? Why did you ask if I had one, too? Just making polite dinner conversation. Your turn. All right. So, what's new in your life? Well, my new shoes are not made for running. Have you been running? No. It's just a suspicion I have. I'm so glad you like it. I do. Leonard never cooks for me. Well, maybe that's 'cause Leonard can't cook. You can't cook and you made me this. Ooh, I'm gonna get the cheesecake out of the fridge. Oh, Lord, I'm in Jewish hell. Look at this. Do you think she's really doing that or is it PhotoShop? I'm pretty sure Martha Stewart never got naked with a room full of big, fat Japanese guys. You don't know that. Prison changes people. I told you, walking. For an hour and a half? I got lost. How could you get lost? Your phone has GPS. Satellites are down. Solar flares. There are no solar flares right now. Yes, there are. Dude, I'm an astrophysicist. If there were solar flares, I'd be all up in it. I'm sorry. I misspoke. What I meant to say was my battery died. What the hell was that about? Do you think this is really Hillary Clinton doing it with Oprah? Oh, we really need to get you a girl. SHELDON Leonard. Leonard. Leonard. Oh, just come in! Thanks for seeing me on such short notice. What do you want, Sheldon? Maybe this isn't a good time. Tell me why you woke me up or I swear to God I will kill you. Do you really think death threats are an appropriate way to begin this conversation? Sometimes your lack of social skills astonishes me. You may want to sit down. I'm in bed! Point taken. You may want to sit up. I've been seeing Penny behind your back. When you say \"seeing Penny, \" what exactly does that mean? We had dinner last night. She made me spaghetti with little hot dogs cut up in it. Well, little hot dog. I gave up the other five hot dogs to a real dog. A real, big dog. A hell hound. Tangential to the primary story. How about I circle back to it? Why did you have dinner with Penny? I told you, she made spaghetti with little hot dogs. I like spaghetti with little hot dogs. Then why did you have Chinese food with us? I didn't want to upset you. Howard made it very clear that my allegiance should be to male comrades before women who sell their bodies for money. Is it possible he said, \"Bros before hos\"? Yes, but I rephrased it to avoid offending the hos. Sheldon, I don't care if you want to be friends with Penny. Oh. Well, so the emotional turmoil that's been keeping me from achieving REM sleep was entirely unjustified? Yes. Well... then as my meemaw would say, \"Looks like we butchered a pig, but nobody wanted bacon.\" And now, as promised, the tangent. Sheldon and the Hell Hound. Or How I Lost My Hot Dogs. Oh, um... I, I can come back. D-don't be silly. We're neighbors. We're going to run into each other. May as well get used to it. Yeah, I guess you're right. You used to it yet? Nope. Me neither. Oh, Sheldon seemed tthink that I would be upset about you hanging out with him. But I just want you to know it's fine. Oh, oh, good, because, um, his mother called me.\n",

Don't you want to make me feel safe and happy, too? Well, yeah. Yeah, sure. Do you want me to quit football? Look, how am I supposed to trust that you're not just going to stray again? Remember your little fling with Brittany and Santana? I do... all right? Let's face it, Finn... The only way that this relationship is going to work is if we're both losers. Okay. This is how it's gonna happen: I'm going to be quarterback again, then I'm going to throw a touchdown in our first game, and then point to you in the stands so that everybody in the school knows you're my girlfriend. All right? That's very romantic, but... Rachel, you can't ask me to choose between you and football. Well, I am. It's so, so exciting! You know, I can get you backstage if you want. You're all dressed up. You look like a cast member of Kids Incorporated. Well, I really want to loosen up a bit, so I'm, uh, helping the kids do Britney. Outrageous, right? Showtime. Sit down! There's nothing to stand up and cheer about. Hey, Coach! The glee club's doing Britney Spears for the assembly. I just found out. Becky, you're on red alert.

Not sure if you heard, William, but my spinal column was ruptured in a sex riot. Sue, you pulled the alarm. Everything was going fine! You know, William, that's what one Hubert Humphrey said back in 1968 at the start of the Democratic National Convention. But then hippies put acid in everyone's bourbon. And when an updraft revealed Lady Bird Johnson's tramp stamp and tattoos above her ovaries, Mayor Richard J. Daley became so incensed with sexual rage that he punched his own wife in the face and spent the next hour screaming \"Sex party\" into the microphones of all three major networks. Okay, I'm pretty sure none of that happened. You can expect a call very soon from my lawyer... Gloria Allred. I'm gonna sue the pants off you, Will. I'm gonna take your house, your car, your extensive collection of vests. I mean, seriously, you wear more vests than the cast of Blossom. And I'll see you in court. Emma... Look, what I did was a little weird. I know that. It was inappropriate for me to do Britney with the kids. I just thought you wanted me to be less uptight. Will, I just wanted you to relax. You know, not stop being you. You know, Terri's still on your case, you lost at regionals, Glee's still the bottom pickle in the barrel... You and Carl. Yeah. Me and Carl. Especially me and Carl. Look, have you ever noticed that Britney Spears only makes great music when she's not chasing down paparazzi? She can't just swallow a grenade and let her talent explode all over the wall. She's got to rein it in, just like you do. You're such a great teacher, Will. No, probably the best in the whole school. So why would you want to be someone else when the someone that you already are is so amazing? Because the boring someone I already am... wasn't good enough for you. Hey, where you going? To return that car. U.S. History... Crap, I forgot I was taking that. Congrats, Finn. You're back on the team, I'm head cheerleader again. Some kind of symmetry, don't you think? With all the nastiness between you and I behind us, I think we should be together. We'd be a shoo-in for Homecoming king and queen. So what do you say? You and me, 8:00, Breadstix? Look, I'd be lying if I said I didn't have feelings for you. Probably always will. But I'm not gonna get back together with you. There's someone else, and you know who that is. I'm asking you to respect that. I said what you wanted me to, he shot me down. So congrats. Looks like he really loves you. I have a song that I've prepared for the class. Sorry, Rachel, no Britney. I'm really happy that her music has inspired so many of you, even if that inspiration was brought about by a dangerous narcotic. And I think we've all come to appreciate her music and celebrity so much more this week. But honestly, she's just not us. I'm devastated. I can't believe we only did one Britney number. I was actually gonna do something from our original assignment last week: Adult Contemporary. But this is just a little bit more Young Adult. Great, Rachel. Well, let's hear it. I'd like to dedicate this song to my boyfriend, Finn. I shouldn't try to control you. I've never been this happy before. And I realize that I was trying to hold onto how you were making me feel so much, that I was strangling you in my hands, like a little bird. I get now, that in order for this relationship to work, I have to open up my hands and let you fly free. Finn can fly? Really? Wait, I thought I was the only one getting the solos from now on.

Who would have thought it was you? Who else would it be? I don't know. Somebody bigger and... Yeah, sure. Why not you? I may have failed. Okay, I guess we just go without a Wonder Woman. I don't want to go without Penny. Oh, great. No Superman, no Wonder Woman? All we've got is a skinny Flash, an Indian Aquaman, a nearsighted Green Lantern, and a teeny, tiny Dark Knight. Obviously, we're no longer a Justice League. We have no choice but to switch to our Muppet Baby costumes. Ooh, I call Kermit. I'm Kermit. You're Scooter. Oh, man. Scooter sucks. He's the Aquaman of the Muppet Babies. No, we can still make this work. Leonard, you talk to Penny. What makes you think I can convince her? You got her to have sex with you. Obviously, your superpower is brainwashing. Okay, let me see if I understand this. You want me to convince my ex-girlfriend to go to a costume party with her new boyfriend just so we can win a stupid prize? Yes. And make her wear the black wig. Go away, Sheldon. It's Leonard. Oh. Go away, Leonard. Come on, let me just talk to you. Hey. I'm not going to that party, Leonard. Okay, listen. You don't have to wear the wig. At this party, we're gonna win first prize just by showing up with a girl. It's not the wig. Did I do something? I mean, I tried to be friends with Zack, like you said, which believe me, was difficult, given how you and me used to be... you know, \"you and me,\" and now you and him are \"you and him.\" Okay, look. We're not really \"me and him.\" Then what are you? I only started seeing Zack again so I wouldn't be alone on New Year's Eve. How pathetic is that? Not as pathetic as dressing up like this and going to a comic book store on New Year's Eve. You make a cute Green Arrow. Green Lantern. Like there's a difference. There's a big difference. Arrow. Whatever. Look, if Zack and I had just gone to a regular club or a party, it would have been fine, but this, with the costumes, and you... What about me? Nothing. Let's go to the party. How do I look? Um... I guarantee you'll be the prettiest girl there. Okay, the good news is, we have a Wonder Woman. Oh. Yes. What's the bad news? Superman probably isn't getting laid tonight. Aw, damn. And the award for best group costume goes to... Justice League of America... Number three! Thank you! Thank you so much! Okay. Okay, ten seconds to midnight. No, wait! I have a speech. Seven, six... Stop counting! Five, four, three... This is my moment, dag nab it! Two, one! Happy New Year! I'm not going to say another word until you people settle down. I'm waiting. That was a great party. We should dress like this all the time. Are you high? You're being a bully. Check it out. Those guys are breaking into that car. What should we do? We're the Justice League of America. There's only one thing we can do. Turn around and slowly walk away. Nah. Look, I know our winter thermostat setting is 72 degrees, but I'm a little warm, so I'm going to turn it down. Good Lord, how you frustrate me, Leonard Hofstadter! Fine. Whatcha doin' there? Working on a new plan to catch the roadrunner? The humorous implication being that I am Wile E. Coyote? And this is a schematic for a bird-trapping device that will ultimately backfire and cause me physical injury? What I'm doing here is trying to determine when I'm going to die. A lot of people are working on that research. So what is all this? My family history factoring in longevity, propensity for disease, et cetera. Cause of death for Uncle Carl was KBB. What's \"KBB\"? \"Killed by badger.\" How's that? It was Thanksgiving. Uncle Carl said, \"I think \"there's a badger living in our chimney. Hand me that flashlight.\" Those were the last words he ever spoke to us. I don't think you need to worry about death by badgers being hereditary. Not true. The fight or flight instinct is coded genetically. Instead of fleeing, he chose to fight barehanded against a brawny member of the weasel family. Who's to say that I don't share that flawed DNA? You can always get a badger and find out. But seriously, even if I disregard the Uncle Carl factor, at best I have 60 years left. That long, huh? 60 only takes me to here. I need to get to here. What's there? The earliest estimate of the singularity, when man will be able to transfer his consciousness into machines and achieve immortality. So, you're upset about missing out on becoming some sort of freakish self-aware robot? By this much. Tough break. You want eggs? You don't get it, Leonard. I'm going to miss so much-- the unified field theory, cold fusion, the dogapus. What's a dogapus? The hybrid dog and octopus. Man's underwater best friend. Is somebody working on that? I was going to. I planned on giving it to myself on my 300th birthday. Wait a minute. You hate dogs. A dogapus can play fetch with eight balls.

He said, \"If he had woman parts, he'd eat for free the rest of his life\". Yeah, but you wouldn't be able to talk to yourself. I'm a little low on cash. How much you got? Nothing. How can you walk around with no money? I'm cute. I get by. It's okay, you can owe me. Thank you. Sheldon, six bucks. No, thank you. I'm not eating pizza tonight. But it's Thursday. Thursday's pizza night. Not for me. Thursday is now Cruciferous Vegetable Night. Tonight's selection: Brussels sprouts. You're changing the Sheldonian calendar? It's a small price to pay. For what? No, no, don't ask. Sorry, sorry, sorry, sorry, sorry. In order to live long enough to fuse my consciousness with cybernetics, I need to change my diet. Wait. Cybernetics is robot stuff, right? So you want to turn yourself into some sort of robot? Essentially, yes. Okay, here's my question. Didn't you already do that? No. Flattering, but sadly, no. I'm also planning to begin an exercise regimen designed to strengthen my cardiovascular system. AKA jogging. Wait. Honey, have you ever run before? Certainly. I've run from bullies, dogs, angry chickens... and one particularly persistent P.E. teacher determined to bend me over and give me a scoliosis test. You're right. Penny jogs. Maybe you guys can run together. That's an excellent idea. Yeah, if we chat, it will create the illusion of time going faster. Um, how does he know I jog? Oh, he watches you from his car with high-powered binoculars. Oh, my God, that is so creepy! I know! And he says he's not gonna stop. Then see a shrink and figure out how to talk to women. I have pain radiating from my navel to my lower right abdomen. I'm nauseated and feverish. I believe I may have cholera. There's no cholera in Pasadena. Just like last summer, when there was no malaria in Pasadena. Well, if it's not cholera, then based on a quick Internet search, the other explanations in decreasing order of likelihood are Hirschsprung's Disease, botulism, a 30-foot tapeworm or accidental ingestion of chrysanthemum blossoms. When would you have accidentally eaten chrysanthemum blossoms? It's part of an unlikely scenario that involves sleepwalking and a 24-hour flower mart with a less-than- vigilant proprietor. Oh, Lord, my belly! Ever had your appendix out? I haven't. I've been meaning to, but who has the time? Let's get you to the hospital. So this is how it ends... with cruel irony. Just as I make the commitment to preserving my body, I am betrayed by my appendix, a vestigial organ. Do you know the original purpose of the appendix, Leonard? No. I do. And yet I'm doomed while you live on. Funny how things work out, isn't it? Oh, Lord, I think it's about to burst! On the other hand, it might have been the Brussels sprouts. Appendicitis. What a nervous Nelly. Hey, nice knees. They're my mother's. Oh. And the Flash shirt is what? Because, what, you're gonna run really fast? No, the Flash shirt is because it's Friday, but it's nice when things work out. Where's your heart rate monitor? I don't have one. What about your pedometer? Don't have one. Do you have telematics in your shoes connected to an iPod? Uh, no. What do you do, you just go out there and gambol about like a bunny? No. I just run till I'm hungry, then I stop for a bear claw. Why are you doing that? It's good to stretch your muscles before you run. All right. All right, let's start with a toe touch. Okay, you do it. I am doing it. Oh. Wow. Good job. Okay, um, can you do this? We'll never know. Okay, let's just warm up on the run. Okay. Okay, let's go. I've been reading up on biomechanics. I think you'll be surprised at my...

You thought I was gonna ask you to go with me to the mineral show. That's very nice of you, but... I do have a boyfriend. That's what you all say. You just don't want to go out with me because I have an off-putting personality. My boyfriend has an off-putting personality, too. Like, way worse than you. I mean, I'm big and weird and funny-looking and no one ever wants to do anything with me. It's okay. I know I'm a monster. No, Bert, come on. I'd love to go to the mineral show with you. Sweet. It's a date. No, it's not. Haven't seen this many people in my store since that Korean church bus crashed through my front window. Hey! Stuart! Haven't seen you in forever. Look how gray you've gotten. My hair's exactly the same color as always. No, I was talking about your skin. Look, uh, my friend here needs a comic book... Ooh! And she went into your store by mistake. Good thing there was no one there to see you. What do you need? Oh, yeah, yeah. I got this. Even you, Sweatpants? Free popcorn. Can I offer you a coffee? Espresso? Latte? How about you, Stu? Mocha? Scone? Directions to the nearest soup kitchen? Hey. I'm just kidding. He knows where the soup kitchen is. It's on Merton Avenue. I don't think I like the way you're treating my friend. You want the book or not? Not from you. Let's go, Stuart. You know something, Jesse? You may have a successful business a-and the kind of pink complexion that comes with good nutrition but I have something more important. Friendship. Which I would trade in a heartbeat for all of this. The mineral and rock show? That would be awful even without Bert. So what am I supposed to do now? Prepare your uterus for his gigantic offspring? I'm gonna have to tell him the truth: that even if I didn't have a boyfriend, I wouldn't be interested in him. I've heard those words so many times. From Linda Nosenchuck, Tammy Rosenworcel... Padma Kapur, Neha Chowdury Marci Grossman, Lisa Mazzarino... Megan Pincus... Tammy Cho... Oh, who was that girl from our Starbucks? Arlene Russel! Arlene! She wrote \"no way\" on both our cappuccinos. Poor Bert. That guy's got a rough afternoon ahead of him. Well, how would you want a girl to tell you she wasn't interested? I guess, uh, I'd like her to sit me down, look me in the eye and say, \"I was wrong. I love you.\" And then maybe she could touch me in a special way. That's how you reject a guy. Okay, I don't have time for this. I'm just gonna go find him and be brutally honest. He'll be so upset. He'll probably climb up the Empire State Building and start swatting at planes. You want us to talk to him? You would do that? We've both been in his shoes. We'll let him down with compassion and respect. So we tell him she's a lesbian, right? Of course we tell him she's a lesbian. And hold three... two... one. Now let's try Warrior II. And hold.

Yeah, we just want to have the kind of dinner that we've all had here so many times before. Good food, good friends, and sometime around midnight, heartburn that makes you pray for death. Do you need any help in the kitchen? No, we got it. You guys make yourselves comfortable. All right, hey, you two, we're here for Howard right now, okay? Yes, so please behave yourselves. Fine. So I heard you two, uh, wrote a paper together. How's that going? This food is amazing. Mm, and not a vegetable in sight. That's not true. We've got tomatoes right here. All these bright people sitting around a table by candlelight. Feels like we could be an 18th century French salon. Indeed. Penny, a salon is a gathering where intellectuals entertained each other with sparkling conversations about issues of the day. Oh, so it's like The View. Sheldon, The View is a daytime talk show hosted by women. Oh, I'm aware. It features Whoopi Goldberg. She played Guinan on Star Trek: Next Gen. Penny, Next Gen refers to Star Trek... I would like to propose a salon topic. Ooh, please do, Rajesh. The lead in The Hunger Games is a woman. Marvel has made \"Tor\" a female. Wait, who's Tor? You know, Tor, the God of \"Tunder.\" As I was saying, is this a sign that our society is approaching gender equality? Certainly a lot more women are reading comic books now. It's true. At the store, I had to put a seat on the toilet. We won't know if there's equality until female Thor has a baby and the Avengers are cool with her pumping breast milk at work. I wonder if only a baby who is worthy can suckle at the bosom of Thor. Okay, new salon topic. Salons-- dumb thing from a long time ago or interesting thing made dumb by talking about superheroes? Discuss. I don't believe it matters what the topic is. What's crucial for a salon is that we conduct the discussion in an elevated and insightful way. It's all about the execution. Of course you'd focus on that rather than the inspiration. Uh, new salon topic. What's more important, an idea or its execution? Oh, that's fun. Yeah, good for you, Leonard. That's a lovely little notion. Kind of like, \"I wish I could talk to my uncle in Chicago.\" Yeah, now stand back while I invent the telephone. \"Hello? Oh, hold on.\" Leonard, it's your uncle. He says you just got burned. You guys. No, it's okay. We're all adults trying to have an intelligent discussion. At least I am. Howard, what do you think? Well, I guess, as an engineer, I lean towards execution. I spend my days trying to take ideas and make them real. Well said, old chap. I thought eloquence had died; here it stands before us. Starting today, it'll go: Gettysburg Address, \"I have a dream\" and what you just said. Oh, now he's a genius? All you ever do is make fun of him and engineering. Leonard, please. His mother just died. You're being ridiculous. Yeah, so are you. Guys, if I wanted to hear people be bitchy, I'd go to my real salon. Leonard, lots of people could've had that idea, but very few people could've worked out the math the way I did. Lots of people also didn't have that idea, like everyone in the entire world except for me. Oh, well, apparently Leonard thinks he's better than everyone in the whole world, including those fighting for our freedom. Yeah, well, I don't know about you, but I support our boys overseas. And girls. Hey, you already ruined Thor; give it a rest. So I'm just supposed to be okay with you hogging all the credit? ! I didn't hog anything. Unlike you and that weird lasagna with raisins in it. You want some of this? I'll give you some. Sheldon, Leonard, living room, right now! She said my name first; that must kill you. I don't know what you think you're doing, but this is a very difficult time for my husband! We're eating the last food his mother ever made, and you were gonna throw it at each other like children? ! Whatever it is you're fighting about, put it aside, go back in there and be a good friend to Howard or there's no dessert for either of you! Look at me when I'm talking to you! And don't think... You guys ever notice sometimes Bernadette sounds like my mom? I don't hear it. No, not at all. I don't think I've eaten that much in my entire life. It's why my people wandered the desert for 40 years. Took that long to walk it off. You see, Penny, the Israelites were in the desert... So glad you two are done fighting. Right now, I'm just trying to burp without throwing up. Physics Today mentioned the paper. What'd they say? Who cares? Did they mention Leonard? They did. Yay. Good news, I found more Tums. Yay! Leonard, I've been working on an opening joke for our lecture at Berkeley. Oh, I like to laugh. But say it anyway. Okay, um... What do you say to a graduate of the UC Berkeley physics department? I'll have fries with that. Because his education hasn't prepared him for a career in the sciences. You know, when they chase you out of there, you only have to run faster than Sheldon. Are you all set for your trip? Yeah, I think so. I just restocked the old PRK. \"PRK\"? Public restroom kit. Everything a boy needs for making pee pee in new and strange places. I don't see what's crazy about bringing a backpack with your own toilet paper and Purell. Keep going. And rubber gloves, uh, air freshener. Um, noise-cancelling headphones. Oh, danger whistle. Um... pepper spray. Ooh, a multi-language \"occupied\" sign. Uh, let's see. We have seat protectors, uh, booties for my shoes, a clothespin for my nose. Oh, and a mirror on a stick, so I can make sure the person in the stall next to me isn't some kind of weirdo. You still worried some Berkeley girl is gonna steal him away? Yes, who do you think gave him the danger whistle? ♪ Bang! ♪ Would you like to play a physics car game I invented called \"I Can't Spy\"? It's all the nail-biting tension of \"I Spy\" but the added fun of subatomic particles and waves outside the visible spectrum. If it's half as much fun as \"One Times Ten to the Fourth Bottles of Beer on the Wall,\" I'm in. I'll begin. Uh, I can't spy with my little eye something passing right through us. That soy Frappuccino I had. Will you please play the game? I can't spy with my little eye something passing right through us. I don't know, um... If 65 billion solar neutrinos pass through a square centimeter every second, given the surface area of this car is about 60,000 square centimeters, that means 3.9 times ten to the 15th solar neutrinos? I don't want to play anymore. We haven't been on a road trip in a while. This is fun. We get it-- you won the game. Stop bragging. No, listen, we wrote a paper together. Now we get to go to a university and talk about it? That's pretty cool. I suppose it is. In fact, if you'd like to celebrate with a little music, I'd be okay with that. What...? This road trip just got crazy. Play that funky music, white boy. I'm surprised you know that reference. What reference? So, I put stickers on everything we're gonna sell. We just need help taking it all out to the driveway. Can I be in charge of pricing? I've been going to garage sales my whole life. Can you believe I got these pantyhose for a nickel? All right, Amy's in charge of pricing and being 75. Hey, Penny, can you give me a hand with this? Aw, we had one of these growing up. I used to play all the time. Oh, yeah? I love Ping-Pong. Oh, I meant beer pong. I had a table, too, but I didn't have any friends, so all I did was serve. You know, you can leave one side up and play against it. And if I had a friend, they might have told me that. Excuse me. Why is there a sticker on this? It's my TARDIS from Doctor Who. I was planning on moving it in the house. I think you just answered your own question. Come on, one day, this may double in value and be worth half what I paid for it. Sweetie, we have a lot to do. We don't need to decide this right now. Well, I guess as long as you're keeping an open mind. So... they're requesting that the white boy play the funky music, yes? And this music we're listening to right now is funky as well? Let me ask you this. Do you think this song is the music the white boy ultimately plays? It could be. So it's like the musical equivalent of Russell's Paradox, the question of whether the set of all sets that don't contain themselves as members contains itself? Exactly. Well... then I hate it. Music should just be fun. Making great time. Gonna be there pretty early. Will our hotel room be ready? I doubt it. Aren't you worried that sitting in the lobby for a long period of time might attract the attention of the hotel detective? If we do, we'll just tell him to \"hit the bricks, see?\" Seems a little confrontational, but all right. You know, we won't be very far from Skywalker Ranch. Oh, that's true. It's not like we can get in there. I-I don't think George Lucas put his headquarters in the middle of nowhere because he wanted people dropping in. Yoda's swamp was in the middle of nowhere. Tatooine was in the middle of nowhere. Hoth was in the middle of nowhere. That's code, Leonard. He wants us to drop in. We do have time. I mean, we could drive by and just look at it. Yes! Oh... I'm so excited. And I just can't hide it. \"I'm about to lose control, and I think I like it.\" What are you talking about? So when do you guys think you're gonna move in? We're still figuring how much remodeling we want to do. It's tricky finding the right balance between \"tasteful modern\" and \"Jewish mother tchotchke crapfest.\" Have you made a decision about the TARDIS? I think I can sell it if we call it, \"Big British Porta-Potty.\" We're not selling it-- it's mine. You can't just decide. How about I arm-wrestle you? That's not fair. It's like me challenging you to a sexy pants contest. You could play Ping-Pong for it. I would do that. How is that fair? You grew up with a table. Yes, but I mostly used it as a battlefield in an ongoing war between the Transformers and the ThunderCats for control of a bra I had found in the woods. Bernadette, for every episode of Doctor Who Leonard has made me sit through, I will play on your behalf and send that TARDIS back to Gallifrey, where I hate that I know it belongs. Yes, Penny plays for me. That's not fair-- she has upper body muscles. Dude, three-time Sanskriti School for Well-Born Boys badminton champion. That's right-- okay, Raj can play for me. Ooh, you just chose champions. It's like we're reenacting the ancient German practice of trial by combat. Yeah, it's also like when the Mountain fought the Red Viper in Game of Thrones. Leonard makes you watch that, too? No, no, I like that show. It's got dragons and people doing it. So it's settled. The fate of Doctor Who's TARDIS will be decided by a Game of Thrones inspired death-match on the battlefield of ThunderCats versus Transformers. If you still have that bra, I'll give you a nickel for it. There it is. It's just a gate. On a road. Wasn't even that hard to find. This is so amazing! I know! You want to get a picture? I want more than a picture. I want to go in. Well, so do I, but they'll never let us. Is that the attitude that helped you get Penny? No, but I don't have three years to make that gate feel sorry for me. Uh, there's a speaker box. Drive up, push the button, and let's see what happens. Okay, yeah. What do we have to lose? I'm a little nervous. Well, get over it. Confidence is key in these situations. You pushed it-- are you out of your mind? ! May I help you? Uh, uh... we don't have an appointment, and-and we don't belong here, but we-we're, like, crazy-big fans. \"crazy for Star Wars\" crazy, not crazy like we have a backpack full of duct tape, although we do have a backpack that you really don't want to look in. You're blowing it. We want to meet George Lucas and become his friends and play with him! This speaker's not working, just pull up. And that's how it's done. All right, we've defeated the first challenge. Now we must steel ourselves to face the monster who defends the gate. We're trying to get past a security guard, not rescue Zelda. I think what really needs to be rescued is your sense of whimsy, but one quest at a time. So what's the plan? Uh, I'm just gonna be honest with the guy. Honesty will never get us in. Well, what's your plan? All right, my plan is predicated on the assumption that they have a nurse's office and your willingness to be lightly stabbed. Who are you here to see? Uh, I'm just gonna tell you the truth. Oh, you are killing me. We don't have an appointment. We-we're just fans of Mr. Lucas's work, and we thought we'd take a shot and see if we could get in and look around. Sorry, guys, we get this a lot. Can't let you in. What if I told you that I was the voice of Yoda? A recording session I must attend.\n",

Also, Wolowitz invited us all to dinner, so... I'm ready whenever you are. All he had was an idea. Well, that is an important part. Oh, please! I have ideas all day long. Reverse SeaWorld where dolphins are allowed to pet people. A new clothing size between medium and large called Marge. Snow White retold from the point of view of Sneezy. Why won't Doc prescribe him something? We finally find out. But Leonard's idea was good. Fine. Then Grumpy-- what's he so grumpy about? Maybe his girlfriend won't take his side. I'm the one who thought of it! Well, didn't he do a lot of the work? But now he's happy to let people think he's responsible for everything. And that's why you get an iPad helicopter! Is it my fault I have a much bigger reputation than he does? Is it my fault that my name came first on the paper alphabetically? Not your fault. Is it my fault that when the reporter cited me as the lead scientist I didn't correct him? Hey, look at that pretty bird. He always needs all the attention. He's such a baby. I swear, he is never ever playing with my helicopter. Okay, I'll start heating some of this stuff up. This is the boutonniere from my high school prom a piece of cake from my Bar Mitzvah. Did she throw anything away? If I find my foreskin, I'm gonna kill myself. Okay, so we've got, um, three briskets, four meatloafs, one lasagna... No, that's noodle kugel. One Jewish lasagna two pound cakes that are about eight pounds each, and one giant container of matzah ball soup. Ma always kept it on hand, in case I got sick. She thought she could cure anything with her cooking. Even the time I got food poisoning. From her cooking. You okay? Yeah, I'm okay. Let's get started. You got it. I'm never gonna talk to her again. Should we tell everyone not to come? No. I want to do this. Okay. Well, I'll keep it together if you can. I'm not making any promises! Glad you guys could make it.

Did she throw anything away? If I find my foreskin, I'm gonna kill myself. Okay, so we've got, um, three briskets, four meatloafs, one lasagna... No, that's noodle kugel. One Jewish lasagna two pound cakes that are about eight pounds each, and one giant container of matzah ball soup. Ma always kept it on hand, in case I got sick. She thought she could cure anything with her cooking. Even the time I got food poisoning. From her cooking. You okay? Yeah, I'm okay. Let's get started. You got it. I'm never gonna talk to her again. Should we tell everyone not to come? No. I want to do this. Okay. Well, I'll keep it together if you can. I'm not making any promises! Glad you guys could make it. Wow, it looks really pretty in here. Yeah, turns out half a dozen menorahs really sets a mood. So, Stuart, have you thought about what you'd do if Howard sells the house? And there goes the mood. Hi. Oh, and a special hello to Leonard, who needs to be mentioned by name. Subtle. But you got it, right? Hey, guys. Hey. Hi. Hello. I just want everyone to know, uh, tonight's not a sad occasion. Yeah, we just want to have the kind of dinner that we've all had here so many times before. Good food, good friends, and sometime around midnight, heartburn that makes you pray for death. Do you need any help in the kitchen? No, we got it. You guys make yourselves comfortable. All right, hey, you two, we're here for Howard right now, okay? Yes, so please behave yourselves. Fine. So I heard you two, uh, wrote a paper together. How's that going? This food is amazing. Mm, and not a vegetable in sight. That's not true. We've got tomatoes right here. All these bright people sitting around a table by candlelight. Feels like we could be an 18th century French salon. Indeed. Penny, a salon is a gathering where intellectuals entertained each other with sparkling conversations about issues of the day. Oh, so it's like The View. Sheldon, The View is a daytime talk show hosted by women. Oh, I'm aware. It features Whoopi Goldberg. She played Guinan on Star Trek: Next Gen. Penny, Next Gen refers to Star Trek... I would like to propose a salon topic. Ooh, please do, Rajesh. The lead in The Hunger Games is a woman. Marvel has made \"Tor\" a female. Wait, who's Tor? You know, Tor, the God of \"Tunder.\" As I was saying, is this a sign that our society is approaching gender equality? Certainly a lot more women are reading comic books now. It's true. At the store, I had to put a seat on the toilet. We won't know if there's equality until female Thor has a baby and the Avengers are cool with her pumping breast milk at work. I wonder if only a baby who is worthy can suckle at the bosom of Thor. Okay, new salon topic. Salons-- dumb thing from a long time ago or interesting thing made dumb by talking about superheroes? Discuss. I don't believe it matters what the topic is. What's crucial for a salon is that we conduct the discussion in an elevated and insightful way. It's all about the execution. Of course you'd focus on that rather than the inspiration. Uh, new salon topic. What's more important, an idea or its execution? Oh, that's fun. Yeah, good for you, Leonard. That's a lovely little notion. Kind of like, \"I wish I could talk to my uncle in Chicago.\" Yeah, now stand back while I invent the telephone. \"Hello? Oh, hold on.\" Leonard, it's your uncle. He says you just got burned. You guys. No, it's okay. We're all adults trying to have an intelligent discussion. At least I am. Howard, what do you think? Well, I guess, as an engineer, I lean towards execution. I spend my days trying to take ideas and make them real. Well said, old chap. I thought eloquence had died; here it stands before us. Starting today, it'll go: Gettysburg Address, \"I have a dream\" and what you just said. Oh, now he's a genius? All you ever do is make fun of him and engineering. Leonard, please. His mother just died. You're being ridiculous. Yeah, so are you. Guys, if I wanted to hear people be bitchy, I'd go to my real salon. Leonard, lots of people could've had that idea, but very few people could've worked out the math the way I did. Lots of people also didn't have that idea, like everyone in the entire world except for me. Oh, well, apparently Leonard thinks he's better than everyone in the whole world, including those fighting for our freedom. Yeah, well, I don't know about you, but I support our boys overseas. And girls. Hey, you already ruined Thor; give it a rest. So I'm just supposed to be okay with you hogging all the credit? ! I didn't hog anything. Unlike you and that weird lasagna with raisins in it. You want some of this? I'll give you some. Sheldon, Leonard, living room, right now! She said my name first; that must kill you. I don't know what you think you're doing, but this is a very difficult time for my husband! We're eating the last food his mother ever made, and you were gonna throw it at each other like children? ! Whatever it is you're fighting about, put it aside, go back in there and be a good friend to Howard or there's no dessert for either of you! Look at me when I'm talking to you! And don't think... You guys ever notice sometimes Bernadette sounds like my mom? I don't hear it. No, not at all. I don't think I've eaten that much in my entire life. It's why my people wandered the desert for 40 years. Took that long to walk it off. You see, Penny, the Israelites were in the desert... So glad you two are done fighting. Right now, I'm just trying to burp without throwing up. Physics Today mentioned the paper. What'd they say? Who cares? Did they mention Leonard? They did. Yay. Good news, I found more Tums. Yay! Leonard, I've been working on an opening joke for our lecture at Berkeley. Oh, I like to laugh. But say it anyway. Okay, um... What do you say to a graduate of the UC Berkeley physics department? I'll have fries with that. Because his education hasn't prepared him for a career in the sciences. You know, when they chase you out of there, you only have to run faster than Sheldon. Are you all set for your trip? Yeah, I think so. I just restocked the old PRK. \"PRK\"? Public restroom kit. Everything a boy needs for making pee pee in new and strange places. I don't see what's crazy about bringing a backpack with your own toilet paper and Purell. Keep going. And rubber gloves, uh, air freshener. Um, noise-cancelling headphones. Oh, danger whistle. Um... pepper spray. Ooh, a multi-language \"occupied\" sign. Uh, let's see. We have seat protectors, uh, booties for my shoes, a clothespin for my nose. Oh, and a mirror on a stick, so I can make sure the person in the stall next to me isn't some kind of weirdo. You still worried some Berkeley girl is gonna steal him away? Yes, who do you think gave him the danger whistle? ♪ Bang! ♪ Would you like to play a physics car game I invented called \"I Can't Spy\"? It's all the nail-biting tension of \"I Spy\" but the added fun of subatomic particles and waves outside the visible spectrum. If it's half as much fun as \"One Times Ten to the Fourth Bottles of Beer on the Wall,\" I'm in. I'll begin. Uh, I can't spy with my little eye something passing right through us. That soy Frappuccino I had. Will you please play the game? I can't spy with my little eye something passing right through us. I don't know, um... If 65 billion solar neutrinos pass through a square centimeter every second, given the surface area of this car is about 60,000 square centimeters, that means 3.9 times ten to the 15th solar neutrinos? I don't want to play anymore. We haven't been on a road trip in a while. This is fun. We get it-- you won the game. Stop bragging. No, listen, we wrote a paper together. Now we get to go to a university and talk about it? That's pretty cool. I suppose it is. In fact, if you'd like to celebrate with a little music, I'd be okay with that. What...? This road trip just got crazy. Play that funky music, white boy. I'm surprised you know that reference. What reference? So, I put stickers on everything we're gonna sell. We just need help taking it all out to the driveway. Can I be in charge of pricing? I've been going to garage sales my whole life. Can you believe I got these pantyhose for a nickel? All right, Amy's in charge of pricing and being 75. Hey, Penny, can you give me a hand with this? Aw, we had one of these growing up. I used to play all the time. Oh, yeah? I love Ping-Pong. Oh, I meant beer pong. I had a table, too, but I didn't have any friends, so all I did was serve. You know, you can leave one side up and play against it. And if I had a friend, they might have told me that. Excuse me. Why is there a sticker on this? It's my TARDIS from Doctor Who. I was planning on moving it in the house. I think you just answered your own question. Come on, one day, this may double in value and be worth half what I paid for it. Sweetie, we have a lot to do. We don't need to decide this right now. Well, I guess as long as you're keeping an open mind. So... they're requesting that the white boy play the funky music, yes? And this music we're listening to right now is funky as well? Let me ask you this. Do you think this song is the music the white boy ultimately plays? It could be. So it's like the musical equivalent of Russell's Paradox, the question of whether the set of all sets that don't contain themselves as members contains itself? Exactly. Well... then I hate it. Music should just be fun. Making great time. Gonna be there pretty early. Will our hotel room be ready? I doubt it. Aren't you worried that sitting in the lobby for a long period of time might attract the attention of the hotel detective? If we do, we'll just tell him to \"hit the bricks, see?\" Seems a little confrontational, but all right. You know, we won't be very far from Skywalker Ranch. Oh, that's true. It's not like we can get in there. I-I don't think George Lucas put his headquarters in the middle of nowhere because he wanted people dropping in. Yoda's swamp was in the middle of nowhere. Tatooine was in the middle of nowhere. Hoth was in the middle of nowhere. That's code, Leonard. He wants us to drop in. We do have time. I mean, we could drive by and just look at it. Yes! Oh... I'm so excited. And I just can't hide it. \"I'm about to lose control, and I think I like it.\" What are you talking about? So when do you guys think you're gonna move in? We're still figuring how much remodeling we want to do. It's tricky finding the right balance between \"tasteful modern\" and \"Jewish mother tchotchke crapfest.\" Have you made a decision about the TARDIS? I think I can sell it if we call it, \"Big British Porta-Potty.\" We're not selling it-- it's mine. You can't just decide. How about I arm-wrestle you? That's not fair. It's like me challenging you to a sexy pants contest. You could play Ping-Pong for it. I would do that. How is that fair? You grew up with a table. Yes, but I mostly used it as a battlefield in an ongoing war between the Transformers and the ThunderCats for control of a bra I had found in the woods. Bernadette, for every episode of Doctor Who Leonard has made me sit through, I will play on your behalf and send that TARDIS back to Gallifrey, where I hate that I know it belongs. Yes, Penny plays for me. That's not fair-- she has upper body muscles. Dude, three-time Sanskriti School for Well-Born Boys badminton champion. That's right-- okay, Raj can play for me. Ooh, you just chose champions. It's like we're reenacting the ancient German practice of trial by combat. Yeah, it's also like when the Mountain fought the Red Viper in Game of Thrones. Leonard makes you watch that, too? No, no, I like that show. It's got dragons and people doing it. So it's settled. The fate of Doctor Who's TARDIS will be decided by a Game of Thrones inspired death-match on the battlefield of ThunderCats versus Transformers. If you still have that bra, I'll give you a nickel for it. There it is. It's just a gate. On a road. Wasn't even that hard to find. This is so amazing! I know! You want to get a picture? I want more than a picture. I want to go in. Well, so do I, but they'll never let us. Is that the attitude that helped you get Penny? No, but I don't have three years to make that gate feel sorry for me. Uh, there's a speaker box. Drive up, push the button, and let's see what happens. Okay, yeah. What do we have to lose? I'm a little nervous. Well, get over it. Confidence is key in these situations. You pushed it-- are you out of your mind? ! May I help you? Uh, uh... we don't have an appointment, and-and we don't belong here, but we-we're, like, crazy-big fans. \"crazy for Star Wars\" crazy, not crazy like we have a backpack full of duct tape, although we do have a backpack that you really don't want to look in. You're blowing it. We want to meet George Lucas and become his friends and play with him! This speaker's not working, just pull up. And that's how it's done. All right, we've defeated the first challenge. Now we must steel ourselves to face the monster who defends the gate. We're trying to get past a security guard, not rescue Zelda. I think what really needs to be rescued is your sense of whimsy, but one quest at a time. So what's the plan? Uh, I'm just gonna be honest with the guy. Honesty will never get us in. Well, what's your plan? All right, my plan is predicated on the assumption that they have a nurse's office and your willingness to be lightly stabbed. Who are you here to see? Uh, I'm just gonna tell you the truth. Oh, you are killing me. We don't have an appointment. We-we're just fans of Mr. Lucas's work, and we thought we'd take a shot and see if we could get in and look around. Sorry, guys, we get this a lot. Can't let you in. What if I told you that I was the voice of Yoda? A recording session I must attend.\n",

      "Well... then what if I told you that I added your name to the cable bill? No. Oh. That's just as well. They had me on hold for 20 minutes and I hung up. Also, Wolowitz invited us all to dinner, so... I'm ready whenever you are. All he had was an idea. Well, that is an important part. Oh, please! I have ideas all day long. Reverse SeaWorld where dolphins are allowed to pet people. A new clothing size between medium and large called Marge. Snow White retold from the point of view of Sneezy. Why won't Doc prescribe him something? We finally find out. But Leonard's idea was good. Fine. Then Grumpy-- what's he so grumpy about? Maybe his girlfriend won't take his side. I'm the one who thought of it! Well, didn't he do a lot of the work? But now he's happy to let people think he's responsible for everything. And that's why you get an iPad helicopter! Is it my fault I have a much bigger reputation than he does? Is it my fault that my name came first on the paper alphabetically? Not your fault.

Also, Wolowitz invited us all to dinner, so... I'm ready whenever you are. All he had was an idea. Well, that is an important part. Oh, please! I have ideas all day long. Reverse SeaWorld where dolphins are allowed to pet people. A new clothing size between medium and large called Marge. Snow White retold from the point of view of Sneezy. Why won't Doc prescribe him something? We finally find out. But Leonard's idea was good. Fine. Then Grumpy-- what's he so grumpy about? Maybe his girlfriend won't take his side. I'm the one who thought of it! Well, didn't he do a lot of the work? But now he's happy to let people think he's responsible for everything. And that's why you get an iPad helicopter! Is it my fault I have a much bigger reputation than he does? Is it my fault that my name came first on the paper alphabetically? Not your fault. Is it my fault that when the reporter cited me as the lead scientist I didn't correct him? Hey, look at that pretty bird. He always needs all the attention. He's such a baby. I swear, he is never ever playing with my helicopter. Okay, I'll start heating some of this stuff up. This is the boutonniere from my high school prom a piece of cake from my Bar Mitzvah. Did she throw anything away? If I find my foreskin, I'm gonna kill myself. Okay, so we've got, um, three briskets, four meatloafs, one lasagna... No, that's noodle kugel. One Jewish lasagna two pound cakes that are about eight pounds each, and one giant container of matzah ball soup. Ma always kept it on hand, in case I got sick. She thought she could cure anything with her cooking. Even the time I got food poisoning. From her cooking. You okay? Yeah, I'm okay. Let's get started. You got it. I'm never gonna talk to her again. Should we tell everyone not to come? No. I want to do this. Okay. Well, I'll keep it together if you can. I'm not making any promises! Glad you guys could make it. Wow, it looks really pretty in here. Yeah, turns out half a dozen menorahs really sets a mood. So, Stuart, have you thought about what you'd do if Howard sells the house? And there goes the mood. Hi. Oh, and a special hello to Leonard, who needs to be mentioned by name. Subtle. But you got it, right? Hey, guys. Hey. Hi. Hello. I just want everyone to know, uh, tonight's not a sad occasion. Yeah, we just want to have the kind of dinner that we've all had here so many times before. Good food, good friends, and sometime around midnight, heartburn that makes you pray for death. Do you need any help in the kitchen? No, we got it. You guys make yourselves comfortable. All right, hey, you two, we're here for Howard right now, okay? Yes, so please behave yourselves. Fine. So I heard you two, uh, wrote a paper together. How's that going? This food is amazing. Mm, and not a vegetable in sight. That's not true. We've got tomatoes right here. All these bright people sitting around a table by candlelight. Feels like we could be an 18th century French salon. Indeed. Penny, a salon is a gathering where intellectuals entertained each other with sparkling conversations about issues of the day. Oh, so it's like The View. Sheldon, The View is a daytime talk show hosted by women. Oh, I'm aware. It features Whoopi Goldberg. She played Guinan on Star Trek: Next Gen. Penny, Next Gen refers to Star Trek... I would like to propose a salon topic. Ooh, please do, Rajesh. The lead in The Hunger Games is a woman. Marvel has made \"Tor\" a female. Wait, who's Tor? You know, Tor, the God of \"Tunder.\" As I was saying, is this a sign that our society is approaching gender equality? Certainly a lot more women are reading comic books now. It's true. At the store, I had to put a seat on the toilet. We won't know if there's equality until female Thor has a baby and the Avengers are cool with her pumping breast milk at work. I wonder if only a baby who is worthy can suckle at the bosom of Thor. Okay, new salon topic. Salons-- dumb thing from a long time ago or interesting thing made dumb by talking about superheroes? Discuss. I don't believe it matters what the topic is. What's crucial for a salon is that we conduct the discussion in an elevated and insightful way. It's all about the execution. Of course you'd focus on that rather than the inspiration. Uh, new salon topic. What's more important, an idea or its execution? Oh, that's fun. Yeah, good for you, Leonard. That's a lovely little notion. Kind of like, \"I wish I could talk to my uncle in Chicago.\" Yeah, now stand back while I invent the telephone. \"Hello? Oh, hold on.\" Leonard, it's your uncle. He says you just got burned. You guys. No, it's okay. We're all adults trying to have an intelligent discussion. At least I am. Howard, what do you think? Well, I guess, as an engineer, I lean towards execution. I spend my days trying to take ideas and make them real. Well said, old chap. I thought eloquence had died; here it stands before us. Starting today, it'll go: Gettysburg Address, \"I have a dream\" and what you just said. Oh, now he's a genius? All you ever do is make fun of him and engineering. Leonard, please. His mother just died. You're being ridiculous. Yeah, so are you. Guys, if I wanted to hear people be bitchy, I'd go to my real salon. Leonard, lots of people could've had that idea, but very few people could've worked out the math the way I did. Lots of people also didn't have that idea, like everyone in the entire world except for me. Oh, well, apparently Leonard thinks he's better than everyone in the whole world, including those fighting for our freedom. Yeah, well, I don't know about you, but I support our boys overseas. And girls. Hey, you already ruined Thor; give it a rest. So I'm just supposed to be okay with you hogging all the credit? ! I didn't hog anything. Unlike you and that weird lasagna with raisins in it. You want some of this? I'll give you some. Sheldon, Leonard, living room, right now! She said my name first; that must kill you. I don't know what you think you're doing, but this is a very difficult time for my husband! We're eating the last food his mother ever made, and you were gonna throw it at each other like children? ! Whatever it is you're fighting about, put it aside, go back in there and be a good friend to Howard or there's no dessert for either of you! Look at me when I'm talking to you! And don't think... You guys ever notice sometimes Bernadette sounds like my mom? I don't hear it. No, not at all. I don't think I've eaten that much in my entire life. It's why my people wandered the desert for 40 years. Took that long to walk it off. You see, Penny, the Israelites were in the desert... So glad you two are done fighting. Right now, I'm just trying to burp without throwing up. Physics Today mentioned the paper. What'd they say? Who cares? Did they mention Leonard? They did. Yay. Good news, I found more Tums. Yay! Leonard, I've been working on an opening joke for our lecture at Berkeley. Oh, I like to laugh. But say it anyway. Okay, um... What do you say to a graduate of the UC Berkeley physics department? I'll have fries with that. Because his education hasn't prepared him for a career in the sciences. You know, when they chase you out of there, you only have to run faster than Sheldon. Are you all set for your trip? Yeah, I think so. I just restocked the old PRK. \"PRK\"? Public restroom kit. Everything a boy needs for making pee pee in new and strange places. I don't see what's crazy about bringing a backpack with your own toilet paper and Purell. Keep going. And rubber gloves, uh, air freshener. Um, noise-cancelling headphones. Oh, danger whistle. Um... pepper spray. Ooh, a multi-language \"occupied\" sign. Uh, let's see. We have seat protectors, uh, booties for my shoes, a clothespin for my nose. Oh, and a mirror on a stick, so I can make sure the person in the stall next to me isn't some kind of weirdo. You still worried some Berkeley girl is gonna steal him away? Yes, who do you think gave him the danger whistle? ♪ Bang! ♪ Would you like to play a physics car game I invented called \"I Can't Spy\"? It's all the nail-biting tension of \"I Spy\" but the added fun of subatomic particles and waves outside the visible spectrum. If it's half as much fun as \"One Times Ten to the Fourth Bottles of Beer on the Wall,\" I'm in. I'll begin. Uh, I can't spy with my little eye something passing right through us. That soy Frappuccino I had. Will you please play the game? I can't spy with my little eye something passing right through us. I don't know, um... If 65 billion solar neutrinos pass through a square centimeter every second, given the surface area of this car is about 60,000 square centimeters, that means 3.9 times ten to the 15th solar neutrinos? I don't want to play anymore. We haven't been on a road trip in a while. This is fun. We get it-- you won the game. Stop bragging. No, listen, we wrote a paper together. Now we get to go to a university and talk about it? That's pretty cool. I suppose it is. In fact, if you'd like to celebrate with a little music, I'd be okay with that. What...? This road trip just got crazy. Play that funky music, white boy. I'm surprised you know that reference. What reference? So, I put stickers on everything we're gonna sell. We just need help taking it all out to the driveway. Can I be in charge of pricing? I've been going to garage sales my whole life. Can you believe I got these pantyhose for a nickel? All right, Amy's in charge of pricing and being 75. Hey, Penny, can you give me a hand with this? Aw, we had one of these growing up. I used to play all the time. Oh, yeah? I love Ping-Pong. Oh, I meant beer pong. I had a table, too, but I didn't have any friends, so all I did was serve. You know, you can leave one side up and play against it. And if I had a friend, they might have told me that. Excuse me. Why is there a sticker on this? It's my TARDIS from Doctor Who. I was planning on moving it in the house. I think you just answered your own question. Come on, one day, this may double in value and be worth half what I paid for it. Sweetie, we have a lot to do. We don't need to decide this right now. Well, I guess as long as you're keeping an open mind. So... they're requesting that the white boy play the funky music, yes? And this music we're listening to right now is funky as well? Let me ask you this. Do you think this song is the music the white boy ultimately plays? It could be. So it's like the musical equivalent of Russell's Paradox, the question of whether the set of all sets that don't contain themselves as members contains itself? Exactly. Well... then I hate it. Music should just be fun. Making great time. Gonna be there pretty early. Will our hotel room be ready? I doubt it. Aren't you worried that sitting in the lobby for a long period of time might attract the attention of the hotel detective? If we do, we'll just tell him to \"hit the bricks, see?\" Seems a little confrontational, but all right. You know, we won't be very far from Skywalker Ranch. Oh, that's true. It's not like we can get in there. I-I don't think George Lucas put his headquarters in the middle of nowhere because he wanted people dropping in. Yoda's swamp was in the middle of nowhere. Tatooine was in the middle of nowhere. Hoth was in the middle of nowhere. That's code, Leonard. He wants us to drop in. We do have time. I mean, we could drive by and just look at it. Yes! Oh... I'm so excited. And I just can't hide it. \"I'm about to lose control, and I think I like it.\" What are you talking about? So when do you guys think you're gonna move in? We're still figuring how much remodeling we want to do. It's tricky finding the right balance between \"tasteful modern\" and \"Jewish mother tchotchke crapfest.\" Have you made a decision about the TARDIS? I think I can sell it if we call it, \"Big British Porta-Potty.\" We're not selling it-- it's mine. You can't just decide. How about I arm-wrestle you? That's not fair. It's like me challenging you to a sexy pants contest. You could play Ping-Pong for it. I would do that. How is that fair? You grew up with a table. Yes, but I mostly used it as a battlefield in an ongoing war between the Transformers and the ThunderCats for control of a bra I had found in the woods. Bernadette, for every episode of Doctor Who Leonard has made me sit through, I will play on your behalf and send that TARDIS back to Gallifrey, where I hate that I know it belongs. Yes, Penny plays for me. That's not fair-- she has upper body muscles. Dude, three-time Sanskriti School for Well-Born Boys badminton champion. That's right-- okay, Raj can play for me. Ooh, you just chose champions. It's like we're reenacting the ancient German practice of trial by combat. Yeah, it's also like when the Mountain fought the Red Viper in Game of Thrones. Leonard makes you watch that, too? No, no, I like that show. It's got dragons and people doing it. So it's settled. The fate of Doctor Who's TARDIS will be decided by a Game of Thrones inspired death-match on the battlefield of ThunderCats versus Transformers. If you still have that bra, I'll give you a nickel for it. There it is. It's just a gate. On a road. Wasn't even that hard to find. This is so amazing! I know! You want to get a picture? I want more than a picture. I want to go in. Well, so do I, but they'll never let us. Is that the attitude that helped you get Penny? No, but I don't have three years to make that gate feel sorry for me. Uh, there's a speaker box. Drive up, push the button, and let's see what happens. Okay, yeah. What do we have to lose? I'm a little nervous. Well, get over it. Confidence is key in these situations. You pushed it-- are you out of your mind? ! May I help you? Uh, uh... we don't have an appointment, and-and we don't belong here, but we-we're, like, crazy-big fans. \"crazy for Star Wars\" crazy, not crazy like we have a backpack full of duct tape, although we do have a backpack that you really don't want to look in. You're blowing it. We want to meet George Lucas and become his friends and play with him! This speaker's not working, just pull up. And that's how it's done. All right, we've defeated the first challenge. Now we must steel ourselves to face the monster who defends the gate. We're trying to get past a security guard, not rescue Zelda. I think what really needs to be rescued is your sense of whimsy, but one quest at a time. So what's the plan? Uh, I'm just gonna be honest with the guy. Honesty will never get us in. Well, what's your plan? All right, my plan is predicated on the assumption that they have a nurse's office and your willingness to be lightly stabbed. Who are you here to see? Uh, I'm just gonna tell you the truth. Oh, you are killing me. We don't have an appointment. We-we're just fans of Mr. Lucas's work, and we thought we'd take a shot and see if we could get in and look around. Sorry, guys, we get this a lot. Can't let you in. What if I told you that I was the voice of Yoda? A recording session I must attend.\n",
